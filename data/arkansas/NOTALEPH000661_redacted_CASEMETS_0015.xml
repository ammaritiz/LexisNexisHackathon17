                <p id="AbL" pgmap="144">Appellees Sandra Dedrick Farmer, Charles W. Dedrick, LaVera Faye Dedrick, and Joseph C. Dedrick are the grandchildren of Millridge Dedrick, Sr., and his wife, Vera, both deceased. This case originated when these grandchildren and their spouses, the remaining appellees, petitioned the trial court to partition the real property at issue in this case by sale and to distribute the proceeds according to the interests of the parties. The appellee grandchildren asserted ownership of the property as heirs of Millridge Dedrick, Sr., and “as tenants in common with Vedell Dickson,” to whom Lorraine Dedrick, Millridge Dedrick, Sr.’s, surviving second wife, conveyed her dower interest in the property. Vedell Dickson’s interest in the property was encumbered by various means that traced through other respondents in the underlying action, including appellant GMAC, the only one of those parties that has appealed the decision granting summary judgment to appellees.</p>
                <p id="b145-4" pgmap="145">On December 13, 2005, appellees moved for summary judgment on their petition, asking the trial court to confirm their title to the property, subject to Dickson’s one-third interest in the property for the life of Lorraine Dedrick under Arkansas Code Annotated section 28-11-301 (Repl. 2004). On December 30, 2005, GMAC, while not challenging any of the facts asserted by appellees, responded by contending that Lorraine conveyed a one-half interest in fee simple to Dickson under section 28-11-307 (Repl. 2004) because Millridge, Sr., died leaving no surviving children — just grandchildren. On January 6, 2006, appellees replied by noting that GMAC had raised a question of law, not fact.</p>
                <p id="b145-5" pgmap="145">On February 6, 2006, GMAC filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, once again asserting that the material facts were undisputed and that the only remaining issue was one of law, and asking the trial court to determine which statute applied, 28-11-301 or 28-11-307. On February 14, 2006, appellees re­sponded to the cross-motion, reaffirming that the only significant issue was one of law — not fact.</p>
                <p id="b145-6" pgmap="145">On February 24, 2006, GMAC — for the first time — by letter notified the trial court that it had located a contract for sale of the property. Then, on February 27, 2006, GMAC attached a copy of an unrecorded land-sale contract, dated September 7, 1996, to its reply in its own cross-motion for summary judgment. In the land-sale contract, Millridge, Sr., as owner of the property, and Lorraine, as his wife, contracted to sell the property in question to Vedell Dickson. The contract contained the provision that it was binding on the parties’ heirs and assigns. In addition, GMAC contended that the contract had been completed because there was a check from Dickson to Lorraine and there was the warranty deed from Lorraine to Dickson, and that the existence of the contract created a question of fact that precluded summary judgment. Based on the discovery of the contract, GMAC also filed an entirely new motion for summary judgment. In their response, appellees maintained that the land-sale contract had been untimely and improperly raised and therefore could not defeat their original motion for summary judgment.</p>
                <p id="b145-7" pgmap="145(52) 146(62)">On October 12, 2006, the trial court held a hearing on all of the motions for summary judgment. On November 17, 2006, the trial court entered its summary judgment in favor of appellees. The trial court made no finding with respect to the land-sale contract. GMAC subsequently filed a post-judgment motion, requesting that the trial court reconsider its summary judgment in favor of appellees and that the trial court make specific findings concerning why the land-sale contract did not create a genuine issue of fact in the case. The trial court did not rule on the post-judgment motion, and it was therefore deemed denied after the passage of thirty days. This appeal then followed.</p>
                <p id="b146-6" pgmap="146">GMAC challenges the trial court’s grant of summary judg­ment to appellees on three bases (1) that appellees failed to make a prima facie showing of entitlement to partition as a matter of law, 2) that GMAC raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether appellees had title to the property they sought to parti­tion, and 3) that the trial court should have applied Arkansas Code Annotated section 28-11-307, rather than section 28-11-301, in deciding this case. We affirm.</p>
                <p id="b146-7" pgmap="146">Background Facts as Set Forth in Appellees’ Motion for Summary Judgment</p>
                <p id="b146-8" pgmap="146">In their brief in support of their motion for summary judgment, appellees set forth the following pertinent facts of the case, which they described as undisputed.</p>
                <p id="b146-9" pgmap="146">Title to the property at issue was originally obtained by Millridge Dedrick, Sr., and Vera Dedrick (Vera), his wife, in October 1950 by warranty deed. Millridge, Sr., and Vera had one child, Millridge, Jr. Appellees are the children of Millridge, Jr., and the grandchildren of Millridge, Sr., and Vera. Vera predeceased both her husband and her son, and Millridge, Sr., subsequently married a woman by the name of Lorraine. Millridge, Jr., died in March of 1997, and Millridge, Sr., died shortly thereafter in July 1997. Millridge, Sr., was survived by his second wife, Lorraine, and his grandchildren by Millridge, Jr. Title to the property was never conveyed to Lorraine. However, on or about October 29, 1999, Lorraine conveyed to Vedell Dickson what purports to be the .entire title to the property by warranty deed. Vedell Dickson subsequently encumbered the property.</p>
                <p id="b146-10" pgmap="146">The appellees attached to their motion for summary judg­ment affidavits in support of the above-asserted facts. In particular, they also attached a certified copy of the redemption deed obtained after the payment of delinquent taxes and recorded in the real-­estate records of Jefferson County, Arkansas.</p>
                <p id="b147-4" pgmap="147">Redemption Deed</p>
                <p id="b147-5" pgmap="147">For its first point of appeal, GMAC contends that appellees failed to make a prima facie showing of entitlement to partition of the property as a matter of law and that the trial court therefore erred in granting them summary judgment. GMAC bases its argument on the fact that appellees “attached a redemption deed by which the Commissioner of State Lands conveyed fee title to the property to Vedell Dickson.” GMAC now explains that the redemption deed was presented by appellees only as proof of their payment of taxes, and that they did not discuss the effect of the redemption deed on their claim of title. GMAC contends, al­though it did not do so below, that “the redemption deed has much greater significance than just being evidence of tax pay­ments,” and that “it is a conveyance of title and, as such, rebuts and contradicts petitioners’ prima facie case of entitlement to summary judgment by creating a genuine issue of material fact as to whether their title is sufficient to support a partition.” GMAC further contends that its failure to raise this argument below is of no moment because appellees failed to carry their burden of making a prima facie case, which meant that the burden of going forward to establish an issue of material fact never shifted to GMAC . We disagree.</p>

                   The problem with GMAC’s argument under this point is that GMAC did respond to appellees’ motion for summary-­judgment, and in doing so it not only failed to raise the issue it now asserts on appeal, but acknowledged that the facts asserted by appellees were not disputed, the dispute being only over the applicable law relating to dower and curtesy. Although GMAC has developed a rather ingenious argument to excuse its failure to raise an issue concerning appellees’ title below, we are not convinced by it. Under the circumstances of this case, appellees’ attachment of the redemption deed to its motion for summary judgment did not undercut its prima facie showing of entitlement to partition of the property. Consequently, because this issue was not raised before the trial court, we do not address it in this appeal.</p>

                <p id="b150-9" pgmap="150">For its second point of appeal, GMAC contends that its introduction of the unrecorded land-sale contract in its reply to its own cross-motion for summary judgment established a genuine issue of material fact that should have prevented the entry of summary judgment on appellee’s behalf.

                <p id="b151-8" pgmap="151">Here, GMAC injected the unrecorded land-sale contract into the summary-judgment process for the first time on February 24, 2006, in a letter to the trial court by which GMAC notified the trial court that the contract had been found. This was after GMAC had responded to appellees’ motion for summary judgment with­out challenging any of the asserted facts and merely contending that Lorraine had conveyed a one-half fee simple interest in the property rather than a one-third life interest as argued by appellees. On February 27, 2006, GMAC attached the unrecorded land-sale contract, dated September 7, 1996, as an exhibit to its reply in its own cross-motion for summary judgment. The contract was not accompanied by any form of affidavit.</p>
                <p id="b152-5" pgmap="152">
                   Thus, at the end of the day, what we have is an exhibit that was attached to GMAC’s reply to its own cross-motion for summary judgment — with no supporting affidavit to establish its authenticity. In addition, GMAC submitted the land-sale contract after having acknowledged in response to appellees’ motion for summary judgment that there were no genuine issues of material fact. We have concluded that under the circumstances of this case the land-sale contract was submitted too late, and it was not submitted in a proper fashion. Thus, it did not create a genuine question of material fact that would preclude the entry of summary judgment.</p>

Mill-­ridge Dedrick, Jr., however, died leaving surviving children — Millridge, Sr.’s grandchildren. The opening clause of section 28-11-307 provides: “If a person dies leaving a surviving spouse and no children . . . .” The opening clause of section 28-11-301 provides: “If a person dies leaving a surviving spouse and a child or children . . . .” Thus, the meaning of the terms “child” and “children” in the quoted statutes is important in deciding this case because we have the interplay between the dower rights of Lorraine Dedrick and the descent and distribution rights of Mill-­ridge, Sr.’s grandchildren.</p>
                <p id="b153-9" pgmap="153">Approximately one hundred years ago, in Starrett v. McKim, 90 Ark. 520, 119 S.W. 824 (1909), our supreme court was faced with determining whether the word “children” included “grand­children” in a predecessor dower statute, Kirby’s Digest section 2709. The court concluded that it did. In all significant respects, that predecessor statute was the same as our current section 28-11-307. In Starrett, our supreme court described the contro­versy as one “between a widow on the one side and grandchildren of a decedent on the other, as to dower interest of the former in lands (not the homestead) left by said defendant. The widow claimed one-half of the land in fee simple, and the grandchildren insist that she takes only an estate for life in one-third of the land.” The court framed the issue as, “Does the word ‘children’ as used in the statute include grandchildren?” In deciding that it did, the supreme court explained:</p>
                <blockquote id="b153-10" pgmap="153(32) 154(39)">It must be conceded that the word “children,” either in a popular or technically legal sense, does not include grandchildren, and its meaning is confined to descendants of the first degree; and it is undoubtedly the rule that where this word is used in a statute it must be construed to mean only descendants of the first degree unless it is apparent from the context that a broader meaning was intended.</blockquote>
                <blockquote id="b154-5" pgmap="154">An analysis of the language of the entire section of the statute shows clearly that the word was used in the broad sense to include descendants of any degree, in contradistinction to collateral heirs. The purpose of the statute is to prescribe the dower interest of a widow as against collateral heirs, when there are no descendants, and as against creditors; and it is divisible into four separate provisions, the first two relating to land which was a new acquisition of the husband, and the last two to lands which were ancestral. The first provision is that, as against collateral heirs, the widow shall take one-half of the land in fee simple when it is a new acquisition, and one-half of the personal property; the second is that, as against creditors, she shall take one-third of such lands in fee simple, and one-third of the personal property; the third is that, as against collateral heirs, the widow shall take a life estate in one-half of the ancestral lands; and fourth, that, as against creditors, she shall take a life estate in one-third of such lands.</blockquote>
                <blockquote id="b154-6" pgmap="154">If any other construction be given to the word “children,” the use of the words “as against collateral heirs” would be entirely superfluous, for under our statute of descents collateral heirs take nothing in any event when direct descendants of the decedent in any degree are left.</blockquote>

                <p id="b154-8" pgmap="154(127) 155(22)">In 1994, our supreme court decided the case of McCoy v. Walker, 317 Ark. 86, 876 S.W.2d 252. McCoy involved homestead rights and the interpretation of Arkansas Code Annotated section 28-l-102(a)(l), which defines “child” under the probate code. Section 28-l-102(a)(l), provides: “ ‘Child’ denotes a natural or adopted child, but does not include a grandchild or other more remote descendant or an illegitimate child except such as would inherit under the law of descent and distribution[.]” In McCoy, our supreme court concluded that the General Assembly did not intend for grandchildren to be included in the definition of “child” under section 28-l-102(a)(l) with respect to homestead rights, even though homestead rights are not part of the probate code. In addition, our supreme court concluded that the General Assembly intended for the clause, “except such as would inherit under the law of descent and distribution,” to only modify “illegitimate children.”</p>
                <p id="b155-5" pgmap="155">
                   In appealing the trial court’s decision to this court, GMAC relies upon McCoy, supra, and appellees rely upon Starrett, supra. We acknowledge that in McCoy, supra, our supreme court applied the statutory definition of “child” from our probate code to a homestead situation, which is not covered by the probate code. However, we decline to apply that definition in the instant case involving dower, which is not included in the probate code either. Instead, we have concluded that Starrett, supra, remains good law and controls the instant case. We, therefore, affirm the trial court in its application of section 28-11-301 to the facts of this case.</p>
