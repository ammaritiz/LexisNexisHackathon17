                <p pgmap="170" id="AuM">The issue in this appeal from the Workers’ Compensation Commission is the right of appellant’s attorney to a fee on the amount of an insurance carrier’s subro-­gation interest in the proceeds of a third-party tort action. The Commission denied the attorney’s fee.</p>
                <p pgmap="170" id="b170-11">On July 8, 1991, the appellant was employed by appellee Lit­tle Rock Dodge when he was involved in an automobile accident with Peggy Nichols. Appellee Chrysler Insurance Corporation paid workers’ compensation benefits to appellant in the amount of $1,981.17. The appellant filed a third-party action against Ms. Nichols, and the claim was settled for $4,981.17. After deduct­ing Chrysler’s subrogation interest, the appellant received $2,000, and his attorney received $1,000. Appellant’s counsel then filed a claim with the Workers’ Compensation Commission contend­ing that he was entitled to an attorney’s fee equal to one-third of Chrysler’s subrogation interest or $660.39.</p>
                <p pgmap="170(41) 171(13)" id="b170-12">Relying on Orintas v. Meadows, 17 Ark. App. 214, 706 S.W.2d 199 (1986), the law judge held that the “reasonable cost of collection” did not include attorney’s fees and because appel­lant’s attorney had no agreement with Chrysler regarding its lien, appellant’s attorney was not entitled to a fee from Chrysler. The Commission affirmed.</p>
                <p pgmap="171" id="b171-4">Ark. Code Ann. § 11-9-410 (1987) provides:</p>
                <blockquote pgmap="171" id="b171-5">(a) LIABILITY UNAFFECTED.</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="171" id="b171-6">(1) The making of a claim for compensation against any employer or carrier for the injury or death of an employee shall not affect the right of the employee, or his dependents, to make claim or maintain an action in court against any third party for the injury, but the employer or his carrier shall be entitled to reasonable notice and oppor­tunity to join in the action. If they, or either of them, join in the action, they shall be entitled to a first lien upon two-­thirds (2/3) of the net proceeds recovered in the action that remain after, the payment of the reasonable costs of col­lection, for the payment to them of the amount paid and to be paid by them as compensation to the injured employee or his dependents.</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="171" id="b171-7">(2) The commencement of an action by an employee or his dependents against a third party for damages by rea­son of an injury to which this chapter is applicable, or the adjustment of any claim, shall not affect the rights of the injured employee or his dependents to recover compensa­tion, but any amount recovered by the injured employee or his dependents from a third party shall be applied as follows:</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="171" id="b171-8">(A) Reasonable costs of collection shall be deducted;</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="171" id="b171-9">(B) Then, in every case, one-third (1/3) of the remainder shall belong to the injured employee or his depen­dents, as the case may be;</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="171" id="b171-10">(C) The remainder, or so much as is necessary to discharge the actual amount of the liability of the employer and the carrier; and</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="171" id="b171-11">(D) Any excess shall belong to the injured employee or his dependents.</blockquote>
                <p pgmap="171(11) 172(138)" id="b171-12">In arguing that attorney fees should be included in the “cost of collection,” appellant analogizes Ark. Code Ann. § 11-9-410 to Ark. Code Ann. § 23-89-207 (Repl. 1992) (applicable to auto­mobile liability insurance) which provides that an insurer has a right of reimbursement out of any recovery in an automobile col­lision, “less the cost of collection.” It has been held that “cost of collection” under this statute includes attorney’s fees.

                <p pgmap="172" id="b172-6">In the Orintas case, Mr. and Mrs. Meadows were employ­ees of the Bendix Corporation of Indiana. They had both been injured in a compensable automobile accident in Arkansas and had both collected workers’ compensation benefits from the Ben­dix Corporation. They hired an attorney, Richard Orintas, who agreed to accept a 35 percent contingency fee, and a third-party claim was filed against the estate of the Arkansas driver. The claim was settled for the policy limit of $50,000. A dispute then arose as to how to the proceeds of the settlement should be dis­tributed. The Bendix Corporation contended it was entitled to two-thirds of the $50,000 settlement ($33,334), that the Mead­ows were entitled to one-third ($16,666), and that the appellants’ attorney, Mr. Orintas, should receive only 35 percent of the Mead­ows’ $16,666. Mr. Orintas contended he was entitled to 35 per­cent of the entire $50,000 settlement. The circuit court agreed with the Bendix Corporation.</p>
                <p pgmap="172" id="b172-7">On appeal, Orintas argued that attorneys’ fees are included in the “reasonable costs of collection” and that he, therefore, was entitled to 35 percent of the $50,000 settlement before the pro­ceeds were divided. This court stated:</p>
                <blockquote pgmap="172(45) 173(245)" id="b172-8">Next, the appellant argues that, although Indiana law should be applied to the division of the settlement pro­ceeds, under Ark. Stat. Ann. Section 81-1340 (Repl. 1976) [now codified as Ark. Code Ann. § 11-9-410], attorneys fees are included under reasonable costs of collection. There­fore, his 35% attorney fee should be deducted from the entire $50,000 settlement before the proceeds are divided between the parties. In Burt v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem­nity Co., 252 Ark. 1236, 483 S.W.2d 218 (1972), the court refused to allow the employee’s attorney fee to be consid­ered costs of collection under Ark. Stat. Ann. Section 81-­1340. Citing Winfrey &amp; Carlile v. Nickles, 223 Ark. 894, 270 S.W.2d 923 (1954), the court in Burt stated that, in the usual situation, the question of an allowance of fees to the employee’s attorney as part of the costs of collection would not likely arise, because the intervening carrier would either retain the employee’s counsel for a fee mutually agreed upon or the employer would employ another attor­ney of his own choice. Under these circumstances, the court would simply apportion the recovery, leaving each to pay his own attorney. 252 Ark. at 1240-1; Nickles, 223 Ark. at 900. Accord, St Paul-Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Lanza, 131 F. Supp. 684 (W.D. Ark. 1955); Phillips v. Morton Frozen Foods, 313 F. Supp. 228 (E.D. Ark. 1970). In the case at bar, Bendix Corporation employed its own attorney to pur­sue the estate of the third-party tortfeasor, and in view of the circuit judge’s superior ability to evaluate the situa­tion, we cannot say the trial court committed error in refus­ing to allow the appellant his attorney fees as costs of col­lection under Section 81-1340.</blockquote>

                <p pgmap="173" id="b173-5">In Burt v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. (cited in Orin-­tas, supra) appellant Opal Burt was injured during the course of her employment with Wal-Mart and was paid workers’ compen­sation benefits by its insurance carrier, Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Company. She then brought an action against D.T. Allen Construction Company, as a third-party tortfeasor, whose liability insurance coverage was also furnished by Hartford. Hart­ford employed attorneys to seek an intervention to protect its subrogation lien and another firm of attorneys to defend the con­struction company. In those peculiar circumstances our supreme court held that Burt’s attorney was not entitled to a fee out of Hart­ford’s subrogation interest.</p>
                <p pgmap="173(12) 174(145)" id="b173-6">In the case of Winfrey &amp; Carlile v. Nickles (cited in the Orintas case), Nickles had been killed in an automobile accident within the scope of his employment. The employer’s insurance carrier, St. Paul-Mercury Indemnity Company, paid workers’ compensation benefits to Mr. Nickles’ dependent parents. The Steins (occupants of the car which collided with the Nickles’ truck) brought suit for damages against Nickles’ estate and the estate hired the Hardin law firm to defend and file a cross-com­plaint for the wrongful death of Nickles. The Hardin firm was. to receive 50 percent of any recovery. St. Paul hired attorney G. Byron Dobbs to file an intervention to protect its subrogation lien. It just so happened that St. Paul had also issued an automobile liability policy to the Steins and was required to defend them against the cross-complaint of the Nickles’ estate. Therefore, St. Paul hired another law firm, Shaw, Jones &amp; Shaw, to defend the Steins.</p>
                <p pgmap="174" id="b174-6">The sum of $6,433.10 was recovered for the Nickles’ estate, the money was paid into the registry of the court, and then a question arose as to how the money should be distributed. The issue was referred by agreement to the Workers’ Compensation Commission which held the Hardin firm was entitled'to a fee only from that portion of the judgment that belonged to the Nick­les’ estate. On appeal, the circuit court set aside the Commis­sion’s action and held that the Hardin firm was entitled to half of the entire net recovery, after deduction of costs and expenses. The Arkansas Supreme Court said it was entirely through the efforts of the Hardin firm that the recovery was made, and it affirmed the circuit court’s decision.</p>
                <p pgmap="174" id="b174-7">In Maxcy v. John F. Beasley Construction Co., 228 Ark. 253, 306 S.W.2d 849 (1957), our supreme court had considered Ark. Stat. Ann. § 81-1340 in a case in which the injured employee contracted to pay his attorney 50 percent of any recovery. A set­tlement was reached between the injured-employee and the defen­dant for $10,016.50. Maxcy then applied to the Workers’ Com­pensation Commission for approval of a settlement and an order of distribution was entered which held as follows: to appellant’s attorney a $5,000 fee plus $142.40 costs, for a total of $5,142.40; of the remaining $4,851.60, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company was awarded $3,234.40; and the remaining $1,617.20 was paid to the employee, Maxcy. The court approved the distribution, stating:</p>
                <blockquote pgmap="175" id="b175-3">It seems clear to us that the above section [Ark. Stat. Ann. § 81-1340], after giving an injured employee the right to sue a third party for his injury and providing that the employer may join in such action and thereby be entitled to a first lien on two-thirds of the net proceeds recovered, and providing that the commencement of such action should not affect the employee’s right to recover compensation, there is the further provision that any amount recovered by the employee from a third party shall be applied, after deducting reasonable costs of collection: “ — one-third of the remainder shall in every case belong to the injured employee or his dependents as the case may be; the remain­der or so much thereof as is necessary to discharge the actual amount of the liability of the employer and the car­rier; and any excess shall belong to the injured employee or his dependents.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="175" id="b175-4">It is our view that the order of the commission direct­ing distribution, after allowing reasonable costs of collec­tion, in the circumstances here is strictly in accordance with the above statutory authority and is correct.</blockquote>
                <p pgmap="175" id="b175-5">228 Ark. at 255-56, 306 S.W.2d at 851.</p>
                <p pgmap="175" id="b175-6">More recently, our supreme court considered a similar sit­uation in Continental Casualty Co. v. Sharp, 312 Ark. 286, 849 S.W.2d 481 (1993). Sharp had sustained a compensable back injury and appellant provided workers’ compensation insurance for the employer. Sharp and his wife hired attorney James Filyaw and brought a third-party-negligence action against Don Bull and Terracon Consultants, et al. Appellant hired an attorney and sought to intervene to preserve its right to a subrogation lien pur­suant to Ark. Code Ann. § 11-9-410 (1987).</p>
                <p pgmap="175(77) 176(15)" id="b175-7">The Sharps’ third-party action proceeded to trial, and a ver­dict was rendered in their favor in the amount of $456,893.60. The court entered judgment on the verdict, and attorney Filyaw, in accordance with his one-third contingency fee agreement with Sharp, received one-third of the gross recovery — $152,297.86. Filyaw was also reimbursed costs in the amount of $4,170.29. After deducting these costs of collection under § 11-9-­410(a)(2)(A), the net recovery to be distributed (between the Sharps and Continental Casualty Co.) under (B), (C) and (D) of § 11-9-410(a)(2) was $300,425.45.</p>
                <p pgmap="176" id="b176-6">Accordingly, the Sharps were first entitled to one-third of this net figure, or $100,141.81, leaving $200,283.64 as the bal­ance to be distributed. Because the remaining balance exceeded the workers’ compensation benefits CCC had paid the Sharps, CCC was reimbursed only the $128,424.77 it had paid in bene­fits, and the remaining or excess, $71,858.87, was awarded the Sharps, fixing their total recovery at $172,000.68. The Sharps contested CCC’s receipt of the full amount of its subrogation-­lien amount, arguing CCC should pay one-third of such amount, $42,808.25, as collection costs since CCC exerted no effort or assistance in pursuing the third-party action.</p>
                <p pgmap="176" id="b176-7">Mr. Sharp filed a declaratory judgment action against CCC, asserting CCC would be unjustly enriched if it were reimbursed its entire amount of benefits. The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment for Sharp, finding that (1) prior to trial of the third-party action, the Sharps requested CCC to share in the cost of prosecuting the third-party action and CCC refused to participate, (2) the recovery of $456,893.60 in the third-party action was due primarily to the efforts of the Sharps’ attorney in investigating, developing, preparing and trying the third-party action and (3) CCC was not entitled to accept the benefits of the services of the Sharps’ attorney without payment of a reason­able attorneys’ fee. The trial court awarded Sharp one-third of CCC’s subrogation lien amount, $42,808.25. This was in addi­tion to the previous attorney’s fee Filyaw had received. Our supreme court held:</p>
                <blockquote pgmap="176" id="b176-8">The trial court erred in awarding Sharp an attorney’s fee from CCC’s subrogation lien award because the cir­cuit judge presiding over the earlier third-party action had already awarded the Sharps the full amount of attorney’s fee ($152,297.86) as part of the “costs of collection” required under § 1 l-9-410(a)(2)(A). Because these fees and costs were initially deducted from the full amount of the third-party judgment before either the Sharps or CCC were distributed their respective statutory awards under § 11-9-410(a)(2), CCC effectively paid its proportionate share of the attorney’s fees in the Sharps’ third-party action.</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="177" id="b177-3">No additional attorney’s fee is provided by law.</blockquote>
                <p pgmap="177" id="b177-4">312 Ark. at 289, 849 S.W.2d at 482.</p>
                <p pgmap="177" id="b177-5">
                   Thus, it appears that whether or not the cost of col­lection includes the fee for the employee’s attorney on the entire settlement or recovery must be judged on the facts of each case and depends on whether or not the workers’ compensation car­rier has reached an agreement with the employee’s attorney to rep­resent its interest in the third-party action, whether the carrier has had its own attorney participate in the third-party action, or whether the carrier has sat back and allowed the employee’s attor­ney to do all the work and either settle the case or proceed to trial, then when a sum is' recovered by the employee’s attorney, step in and attempt to take its subrogation amount without any compensation to the attorney responsible for the recovery.</p>
                <p pgmap="177" id="b177-6">
                   Since these issues were not developed below, we can­not make a decision on the record before us. Therefore, this case is reversed and remanded to the Workers’ Compensation Com­mission to obtain further evidence, if necessary, and in keeping with this opinion make findings of fact as to whether or not appellee’s insurance carrier had an attorney who participated in any way in the third-party action brought by appellant and his attorney.</p>
                <p pgmap="177" id="b177-7">Reversed and remanded.</p>
