                <p id="AS_B" pgmap="510">This appeal arises from the Marion County Circuit Court granting a petition filed by appellee, Arkansas Department of Human Services (ADHS), to ter­minate the parental rights of appellant, Rebecca Causer, in a dependency-neglect action. Causer’s attorney has filed a no-merit brief and a motion to withdraw, and Causer has filed a letter stating her pro se points for reversal. We must order rebriefing because counsel has failed to address all adverse rulings that occurred during the termination hearing.</p>
                <p id="b510-9" pgmap="510">Appellant Rebecca Causer is a thirty-two-year-old single mother of three children. On March 7, 2003, ADHS removed three children from her home because she was arrested for posses­sion of methamphetamine. At the time they were removed from the home, the children were the following ages: D.M., age twenty months; B.C., age seven; and K.C., age thirteen. K.C. has cerebral palsy. Probable cause to remove the children was found on April 5, 2003. An adjudication that the juveniles were in need of services and were dependent/neglected was made on April 9, 2003. Re­unification was set as the goal of the case and Causer was ordered to undergo a drug evaluation and random drug testing, to attend parenting classes, and to receive job skills training.</p>
                <p id="b510-10" pgmap="510">ADHS provided Causer with intensive family services, homemaker services, transportation, budgeting, and family/individual counseling. After treatment, Causer remained clean and sober, and she was put on probation for her criminal charges. Approximately nine months after the children were removed, they were returned to Causer’s care on a trial placement in December 2003.</p>
                <p id="b510-11" pgmap="510(32) 511(87)">During a March 10, 2004 hearing, it was revealed that Causer had been arrested due to prescription drugs being found on her person. On March 12, 2004, the children were returned to foster care because of Causer’s arrest for disorderly conduct at her children’s day clinic. K.C. and B.C. were behind in school and D.M. had lost twenty-five percent of her body weight during the time she was in her mother’s care. During the three months that Causer had the children, she had been arrested three times. Causer’s probation was then revoked because she tested positive for drugs. On March 22, 2004, the trial court found that there was probable cause to place the children back into foster care.</p>
                <p id="b511-4" pgmap="511">The permanency planning hearing continued the goal of reunification. The trial court found that Causer should have another chance to comply with the case plan to get her children back and to resolve her criminal issues. The trial court allowed B.C. to be placed in the custody of his father. On September 8th and 15th, a fifteen-month permanency planning hearing was held. At this hearing, the trial court found that Causer had not complied with the case plan and other orders of the court. Specifically, she continued smoking in the home, she failed to work on menus for nutritional meals, and she did nothing of her own volition and relied solely on assistance. The trial court found that reunification could not occur within a reasonable time frame consistent with the children’s needs and that Causer does not know how to be a mother.</p>
                <p id="b511-5" pgmap="511">The termination hearing began on December 8, 2004. Melinda Fulton, a clinical social worker and therapist for K.C., testified that Causer has trouble treating K.C. like a child and Causer inappropriately divulges information to her. She also stated that K.C. was thrust into a parenting role with D.C. when Causer was not doing a good parenting job.</p>
                <p id="b511-6" pgmap="511">Diana Mitchell, a caseworker for ADHS, testified that ADHS has offered Causer numerous services and that there were no other services they could offer to Causer. She stated that she thought Causer was capable of parenting but that Causer was just not doing it.</p>
                <p id="b511-7" pgmap="511">Glenn Blacksher, one of the foster parents for the children, testified that he had noticed a positive change in Causer and noted that she was participating in drug court. He stated that the children were doing well in his home. Sharon Blacksher, the other foster parent, also stated that the children were doing well in their care. Sharon Blacksher stated that she thought it was in the children’s best interest to return home to Causer.</p>
                <p id="b511-8" pgmap="511(22) 512(80)">Causer testified that she was participating in a drug court program. She stated that she had been clean for six months. She wanted her children back and stated that she had done her best to comply with the case plan. She has been diagnosed with OCD and has been taking her medication. She completed the OMART rehabilitation program. She kept up with after-care meetings while someone was “looking over her shoulder.” When it was up to her, though, she did not keep up with her after-care. K.C. testified at the hearing, and she stated that she wanted to live with her mother.</p>
                <p id="b512-5" pgmap="512">The trial court found that the conditions that caused re­moval from the home, drug use, had not been remedied and that Causer has manifested the incapacity to remedy subsequent issues (the inability to effectively parent) that have arisen since the original petition. The order stated that Causer has not demon­strated the ability to focus on her children while attending to her own needs. The trial court terminated the parental rights of Causer as to her three children.

                <blockquote id="b512-7" pgmap="512">When the issue is one involving the termination of parental rights, there is a heavy burden placed upon the party to terminate the relationship. Termination of parental rights is an extreme rem­edy and in derogation of the natural rights of the parents. Parental rights, however, will not be enforced to the detriment or destruction of the health and well-being of the child. The facts warranting termination of parental rights must be proven by clear and convinc­ing evidence, and in reviewing the trial court’s evaluation of the evidence, we will not reverse unless the court’s finding of clear and convincing evidence is clearly erroneous. Clear and convincing evidence is that degree of proof which will produce in the fact finder a firm conviction regarding the allegation sought to be established. In resolving the clearly erroneous questions, we must give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of witnesses. Additionally, we have noted that in matters involving the welfare of young children, we will give great weight to the trial judge’s personal observations.</blockquote>

In addition to determining the best interests of the child, the court must find clear and convincing evidence that the circumstances exist that, according to the statute, justify terminating parental rights.

                <p id="b514-6" pgmap="514">Causer’s attorney has filed a motion to withdraw and a no-merit brief pursuant to Linker-Flores v. Ark. Department of Human Services, 359 Ark. 131, 194 S.W.3d 739 (2004). Causer did not appeal from final orders from the adjudication hearing, review, and permanency-planning hearings. Thus, we are precluded from reviewing any adverse rulings from these portions of the record. See Lewis v. Ark. Dep’t of Human Servs., 364 Ark. 243, 217 S.W.3d 788 (2005). Pursuant to Ark. R. App. P. — Civ. 2(c)(3), our review of the record for adverse rulings is limited to the termination hearing. See id. No-merit briefs in termination-of-parental-rights cases “shall include an argument section that consists of a list of all rulings adverse to the defendant made by the circuit court on all objections, motions, and requests made by either party with an explanation as to why each adverse ruling is not a meritorious ground for reversal.” See Ark. Sup. Ct. R. 4-3(j); Lewis, supra. If a no-merit brief fails to address all the adverse rulings, we will generally send it back for rebriefing. Lewis, supra; Linker-Flores v. Ark.

                   In this case, our review of the record reveals at least three rulings adverse to Causer in the termination hearing that were not abstracted or included in the argument sections. Causer made a hearsay objection during the testimony of Melinda Fulton, which the trial court overruled. ADHS objected to speculative testimony by Causer, and the trial court sustained the objection. During Causer’s testimony, the trial court allowed a letter into evidence over Causer’s objection. Because these adverse rulings were not abstracted and discussed, counsel’s brief fails to comply with the requirements of Ark. Sup. Ct. R. 4-3(j) and supreme court precedent. See Linker, supra; Lewis, supra. Accordingly, we deny counsel’s motion to withdraw and order rebriefing.</p>

App. 483, 220 S.W.3d 270 (2005). In response our opinion, Causer’s attorney has petitioned this court to reconsider its order to rebrief, contending that rebriefing in this case would cause further delay and that the four adverse rulings that were not fully discussed in the brief are not meritorious. After reviewing this case, we have treated the petition as a petition for rehearing, and we agree with Causer’s attorney and affirm this case.</p>

                   Causer’s attorney has filed an attachment to her mo­tion to reconsider that specifically addresses and discusses all adverse rulings in the termination hearing. The attachment com­plies substantively with the requirements for argument sections of termination-of-parental-rights no-merit briefs as set out in Linker-­Flores, supra, and Lewis, supra; therefore, rebriefmg in this case is no longer necessary. After a review of the record, we find that all adverse rulings are clearly not meritorious. We affirm today without rebriefing so as to avoid any further delay of this case and grant the motion to withdraw as counsel.</p>
