                <p id="Ag3" pgmap="198">State Farm Insurance Com­pany has appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Garland County denying its post-trial motion for a set-off against a $45,000 jury verdict rendered in favor of David Rose, State Farm’s insured under a policy providing underinsured motorist (“UIM”) coverage. Rose was injured when a driver insured by another insurance company side-swiped his vehicle on July 19, 1991. The insurer for the tortfeasor paid $25,000, the limits under its liability coverage, and Rose then sued State Farm under his UIM coverage claiming damages totalling $95,000. That lawsuit, the basis of this appeal, was tried to a jury that was allowed to hear evidence concerning disability benefits paid to Rose under the disability provision of his policy. However, the trial court refused to allow State Farm to introduce evidence that it had paid $13,133 under the medical payments provision of the policy, despite allowing Rose to introduce evidence of medical expenses he incurred. After the jury returned the verdict for $45,000, State Farm moved for a set-off for the disability and medical payments. The trial court denied the motion for both.</p>
                <p id="b198-9" pgmap="198">On appeal, State Farm argues that the effect of the trial court’s ruling is to permit Rose to obtain a double recovery con­trary to the holding in Shelter Mutual Ins. Co. v. Bough, 310 Ark. 21, 834 S.W.2d 637 (1992). State Farm also argues that the trial court’s decision is contrary to the unambiguous lan­guage of its UIM policy with Rose. The UIM provision includes this language:</p>
                <blockquote id="b198-10" pgmap="198">Medical expenses paid or payable under the medical payments coverage will not be paid for again as damages under this coverage. This does not reduce the limits of lia­bility of this coverage.</blockquote>
                <p id="b198-11" pgmap="198(33) 199(7)">Rose argues, however, that because the jury considered the amount of his damages and returned a general verdict, it would be speculative to presume that any part of the verdict went to the amount that he claimed for medical expenses.</p>
                <p id="b199-6" pgmap="199">
                   We agree with the trial court’s decision denying set-off for the disability payments made to Rose by State Farm under its disability provision. The jury heard testimony from Rose and his wife about the disabling effects of his injuries as well as the likelihood that he would continue to suffer from them. Most importantly, the jury received evidence that State Farm had paid disability benefits to Rose. Therefore, the jury could have taken that proof into account in reaching its verdict. The jury also knew that Rose had already received $25,000 from the tortfeasor’s' insurer, and the jury was instructed to assess Rose’s damages “over and above” that amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, State Farm’s motion for a set-off for the disability payments was prop­erly denied.</p>
                <p id="b200-5" pgmap="200">
                   However, we reverse the trial court’s decision denying State Farm’s motion for a set-off for the medical expenses paid to Rose. It is true that the UIM coverage extended to damages for the bodily injuries that Rose sustained. Yet, the jury did not know — and had no reason to infer from the proof at trial — that all or any part of Rose’s medical expenses had already been paid by State Farm under the medical payments provision of his auto policy. Part of the money received from the tortfeasor’s insurer went to subrogate State Farm, but that left $5,401.42 for which it was not subrogated. To allow Rose to recover a verdict that included the cost of those medical expenses that had already been paid by State Farm would leave Rose with a double recov­ery contrary to the equitable principle of subrogation as demon­strated by the Bough holding, Id., 310 Ark. at 28, 834 S.W.2d at 641 (1992). Furthermore, this result would be contrary to the express and unambiguous language of Rose’s UIM coverage which informed him that medical payments under the medical payments provision of his basic policy would not be paid again as damages under the UIM coverage.</p>
                <p id="b200-6" pgmap="200">
                   At bottom, this case presents a variant of the collateral source rule. The collateral source rule is designed to prevent prejudice by a jury due to the mere presence of collateral sources of support like insurance coverage. Amos v. Stroud, 252 Ark. 1100, 482 S.W.2d 592 (1972). Where, as here, the insurer is a party to the action, the presence of insurance is no longer an issue and the theoretical basis of the rule loses much of its force. The “collateral source” in this case is simply a second provision of the same insurance policy. In such a case, the jury should be permitted to see a more complete financial picture. For the court to admit evidence of medical bills incurred while denying evi­dence of medical payments is to portray a “false and misleading” financial condition. See Younts v. Baldor Elec. Co., 310 Ark. 86, 832 S.W.2d 832 (1992). If this evidence is not admitted during the trial, in the alternative, set-off should be allowed post-trial.</p>
                <p id="b200-7" pgmap="200">Therefore, we affirm that part of the judgment denying State Farm’s motion for set-off for the disability payments. We reverse the part that denied the motion for set-off regarding the medical payments, and remand the case to the trial court with instructions that judgment be entered consistent with this opinion.</p>
                <p id="b201-5" pgmap="201">Affirmed in part; reversed in part.</p>
                <footnote label="1">
                  <p id="b199-7" pgmap="199">1 The jury instruction that the court issued regarding damages read, in pertinent part:</p>
