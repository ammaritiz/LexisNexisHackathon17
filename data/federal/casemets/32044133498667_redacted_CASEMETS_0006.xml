                <p pgmap="209" id="Ak">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
                <p pgmap="209" id="b209-4">Arizona provides tax credits for contributions to school tu­ition organizations, or STOs. STOs use these contributions to provide scholarships to students attending private schools, many of which are religious. Respondents are a group of Arizona taxpayers who challenge the STO tax credit as a violation of Establishment Clause principles under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. After the Arizona Supreme Court rejected a similar Establishment Clause claim on the merits, respondents sought intervention from the Federal Judiciary.</p>
                <p pgmap="209(57) 210(91)" id="b209-5">To obtain a determination on the merits in federal court, parties seeking relief must show that they have standing under Article III of the Constitution. Standing in Estab­lishment Clause cases may be shown in various ways. Some plaintiffs may demonstrate standing based on the direct harm of what is claimed to be an establishment of religion, such as a mandatory prayer in a public school classroom. See School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 224, n. 9 (1963). Other plaintiffs may demonstrate standing on the ground that they have incurred a cost or been denied a benefit on account of their religion. Those costs and benefits can result from alleged discrimination in the tax code, such as when the availability of a tax exemption is conditioned on religious affiliation. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S. 1, 8 (1989) (plurality opinion).</p>
                <p pgmap="210" id="b210-4">For their part, respondents contend that they have stand­ing to challenge Arizona’s STO tax credit for one and only one reason: because they are Arizona taxpayers. But the mere fact that a plaintiff is a taxpayer is not generally deemed sufficient to establish standing in federal court. To overcome that rule, respondents must rely on an exception created in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968). For the rea­sons discussed below, respondents cannot take advantage of Flast’s narrow exception to the general rule against taxpayer standing. As a consequence, respondents lacked standing to commence this action, and their suit must be dis­missed for want of jurisdiction.</p>
                <p pgmap="210" id="b210-5">r-H</p>
                <p pgmap="210(129) 211(85)" id="b210-1">Respondents challenged § 43-1089, a provision of the Ari­zona Tax Code. See 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws § 43-1087, codi­fied, as amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 43-1089 (West Supp. 2010). Section 43-1089 allows Arizona taxpayers to obtain dollar-for-dollar tax credits of up to $500 per person and $1,000 per married couple for contributions to STOs. § 43-­1089(A). If the credit exceeds an individual’s tax liability, the credit’s unused portion can be carried forward up to five years. § 43-1089(D). Under a version of § 43-1089 in effect during the pendency of this lawsuit, a charitable organization could be deemed an STO only upon certain conditions. See § 43-1089 (West 2006). The organization was required to be exempt from federal taxation under § 501(c)(3) of the Inter­nal Revenue Code of 1986. § 43-1089(G)(3) (West Supp. 2005). It could not limit its scholarships to students attend­ing only one school. Ibid. And it had to allocate “at least ninety per cent of its annual revenue for educational scholar­ships or tuition grants” to children attending qualified schools. Ibid. A “qualified school,” in turn, was defined in part as a private school in Arizona that did not discriminate on the basis of race, color, handicap, familial status, or na­tional origin. § 43-1089(G)(2).</p>
                <p pgmap="211" id="b211-5">In an earlier lawsuit filed in state court, Arizona taxpayers challenged § 43-1089, invoking both the United States Con­stitution and the Arizona Constitution. The Arizona Su­preme Court rejected the taxpayers’ claims on the merits. Kotterman v. Killian, 193 Ariz. 273, 972 P. 2d 606 (1999). This Court denied certiorari. Rhodes v. Killian, 528 U.

                <p pgmap="211" id="b211-6">The present action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. It named the director of the Arizona Department of Revenue as defendant. The Arizona taxpayers who brought the suit claimed that §43-­1089 violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amend­ment, as incorporated against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Respondents alleged that §43-1089 allows STOs “to use State income-tax revenues to pay tuition for students at religious schools,” some of which “discriminate on the basis of religion in selecting students.” Complaint in No. 00-0287 (D Ariz.), ¶¶ 29-31, App. to Pet. for Cert, in No. 09-987, pp. 125a-126a. Respondents requested, among other forms of relief, an injunction against the issuance of §43-1089 tax credits for contributions to religious STOs. The District Court dismissed respondents’ suit as jurisdic­tionally barred by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. § 1341. The Court of Appeals reversed. This Court agreed with the Court of Appeals and affirmed. Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (2004).</p>

The full Court of Appeals denied en banc review, with eight judges dissenting. 586 F. 3d 649 (CA9 2009). This Court granted certiorari. 560 U. S. 924 (2010).</p>

                <p pgmap="212" id="b212-4">The concept and operation of the separation of powers in our National Government have their principal foundation in the first three Articles of the Constitution. Under Article III, the Federal Judiciary is vested with the “Power” to re­solve not questions and issues but “Cases” or “Controver­sies.” This language restricts the federal judicial power “to the traditional role of the Anglo-American courts.” Sum­mers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488, 492 (2009). In the English legal tradition, the need to redress an injury resulting from a specific dispute taught the efficacy of judi­cial resolution and gave, legitimacy to judicial decrees. The importance of resolving specific eases was visible, for ex­ample, in the incremental approach of the common law and in equity’s consideration of exceptional circumstances. The Framers paid heed to these lessons. See U. S. Const., Art. Ill, § 2 (“The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity . . . ”). By rules consistent with the longstanding practices of Anglo-American courts a plaintiff who seeks to invoke the federal judicial power must assert more than just the “generalized interest of all citizens in con­stitutional governance.” Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 217 (1974).</p>
                <p pgmap="213" id="b213-3">Continued adherence to the case-or-eontroversy require­ment of Article III maintains the public’s confidence in an uneleeted but restrained Federal Judiciary. If the judicial power were “extended to every question under the constitu­tion,” Chief Justice Marshall once explained, federal courts might take possession of “almost every subject proper for legislative discussion and decision.” 4 Papers of John Mar­shall 95 (C. Cullen ed. 1984) (quoted in DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332,341 (2006)). The legislative and executive departments of the Federal Government, no less than the judicial department, have a duty to defend the Con­stitution. See U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 3. That shared obli­gation is incompatible with the suggestion that federal courts might wield an “unconditioned authority to determine the constitutionality of legislative or executive acts.” Val­ley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Sepa­ration of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 471 (1982). For the federal courts to decide questions of law arising out­side of cases and controversies would be inimical to the Con­stitution’s democratic character. And the resulting conflict between the judicial and the political branches would not, “in the long run, be beneficial to either.” United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 188-189 (1974) (Powell, J., con­curring). Instructed by Chief Justice Marshall’s admoni­tion, this Court takes care to observe the “role assigned to the judiciary” within the Constitution’s “tripartite allocation of power.” Valley Forge, supra, at 474 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>

                <p pgmap="214" id="b214-5">Respondents suggest that their status as Arizona taxpay­ers provides them with standing to challenge the STO tax credit. Absent special circumstances, however, standing cannot be based on a plaintiff’s mere status as a taxpayer. This Court has rejected the general proposition that an indi­vidual who has paid taxes has a “continuing, legally cogniza­ble interest in ensuring that those funds are not used by the Government in a way that violates the Constitution.” Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 599 (2007) (plurality opinion). This precept has been re­ferred to as the rule against taxpayer standing.</p>
                <p pgmap="214(57) 215(121)" id="b214-6">The doctrinal basis for the rule was discussed in Frothing­ham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923) (decided with Massachu­setts v. Mellon). There, a taxpayer-plaintiff had alleged that certain federal expenditures were in excess of congres­sional authority under the Constitution. The plaintiff ar­gued that she had standing to raise her claim because she had an interest in the Government Treasury and because the allegedly unconstitutional expenditure of Government funds would affect her personal tax liability. The Court rejected those arguments. The “effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of funds,” was too “remote, fluctuating and un­certain” to give rise to a ease or controversy. Id., at 487. And the taxpayer-plaintiff’s “interest in the moneys of the Treasury,” the Court recognized, was necessarily “shared with millions of others.” Ibid. As a consequence, Froth­ingham held that the taxpayer-plaintiff had not presented a “judicial controversy” appropriate for resolution in fed­eral court but rather a “matter of public . . . concern” that could be pursued only through the political process. Id., at 487-489.</p>
                <p pgmap="215" id="b215-4">In a second pertinent case, Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429 (1952), the Court considered Froth­ingham’s prohibition on taxpayer standing in connection with an alleged Establishment Clause violation. A New Jersey statute had provided that public school teachers would read Bible verses to their students at the start of each schoolday. A plaintiff sought to have the law enjoined, as­serting standing based on her status as a taxpayer. Writing for the Court, Justice Jackson reiterated the foundational role that Article III standing plays in our separation of powers.</p>
                <blockquote pgmap="215" id="b215-5">“‘The party who invokes the power [of the federal courts] must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.’ ” Doremus, supra, at 434 (quoting Frotkingham, supra, at 488).</blockquote>
                <p pgmap="215(21) 216(89)" id="b215-6">The plaintiff in Doremus lacked any “direct and particular financial interest” in the suit, and, as a result, a decision on the merits would have been merely “advisory.” 342 U. S., at 434-435. It followed that the plaintiff’s allegations did not give rise to a case or controversy subject to judicial reso­lution under Article III. Ibid. Cf. School Dist. of Abing­ton Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S., at 224, n. 9 (finding standing where state laws required Bible readings or prayer in public schools, not because plaintiffs were state taxpayers but because their children were enrolled in public schools and so were “directly affected” by the challenged laws).</p>
                <p pgmap="216" id="b216-3">In holdings consistent with Frothingham and Doremus, more recent decisions have explained that claims of taxpayer standing rest on unjustifiable economic and political specula­tion. ' When a government expends resources or declines to impose a tax, its budget does not necessarily suffer. On the contrary, the purpose of many governmental expenditures and tax benefits is “to spur economic activity, which in turn increases government revenues.” Daimler Chrysler, 547 U. S., at 344.</p>
                <p pgmap="216" id="b216-4">Difficulties persist even if one assumes that an expenditure or tax benefit depletes the government’s coffers. To find in­jury, a court must speculate “that elected officials will in­crease a taxpayer-plaintiff’s tax bill to make up a deficit.” Ibid. And to find redressability, a court must assume that, were the remedy the taxpayers seek to be allowed, “legisla­tors will pass along the supposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions.” Ibid. It would be “pure specula­tion” to conclude that an injunction against a government expenditure or tax benefit “would result in any actual tax relief” for a taxpayer-plaintiff. ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 614 (1989) (opinion of Kennedy, X).</p>
                <p pgmap="216(56) 217(56)" id="b216-5">These well-established principles apply to the present cases. Respondents may be right that Arizona’s STO tax credits have an estimated annual value of over $50 million. See Brief for Respondent Winn et al. 42; see also Arizona Dept, of Revenue, Revenue Impact of Arizona’s Tax Expend­itures FY 2009/10, p. 48 (preliminary Nov. 15, 2010) (report­ing the total estimated “value” of STO tax credits claimed over a 1-year period). The education of its young people is, of course, one of the State’s principal missions and responsi­bilities; and the consequent costs will make up a significant portion of the state budget. That, however, is just the be­ginning of the analysis.</p>
                <p pgmap="217" id="b217-4">By helping students obtain scholarships to private schools, both religious and secular, the STO program might relieve the burden placed on Arizona’s public schools. The result could be an immediate and permanent cost savings for the State. See Brief for Petitioner Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization 31 (discussing studies indicating that the STO program may on net save the State money); see also Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 395 (1983) (“By educating a substantial number of students [private] schools relieve pub­lic schools of a correspondingly great burden — to the benefit of all taxpayers”). Underscoring the potential financial ben­efits of the STO program, the average value of an STO schol­arship may be far less than the average cost of educating an Arizona public school student. See Brief for Petitioner Garriott 38. Because it encourages scholarships for attend­ance at private schools, the STO tax credit may not cause the State to incur any financial loss.</p>
                <p pgmap="217(110) 218(10)" id="b217-5">Even assuming the STO tax credit has an adverse effect on Arizona’s annual budget, problems would remain. To •conclude there is a particular injury in fact would require speculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue short­falls by increasing respondents’ tax liability. Daimler-­Ckrysler, 547 U. S., at 344. A finding of causation would depend on the additional determination that any tax increase would be traceable to the STO tax credits, as distinct from other governmental expenditures or other tax benefits. Re­spondents have not established that an injunction against application of the STO tax credit would prompt Arizona leg­islators to “pass along the supposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions.” Ibid. Those matters, too, are conjectural.</p>
                <p pgmap="218" id="b218-3">Each of the inferential steps to show causation and re­dressability depends on premises as to which there remains considerable doubt. The taxpayers have not shown that any interest they have in protecting the state treasury would be advanced. Even were they to show some closer link, that interest is still of a general character, not particular to cer­tain persons. Nor have the taxpayers shown that higher taxes will result from the tuition credit scheme. The rule against taxpayer standing, a rule designed both to avoid speculation and to insist on particular injury, applies to re­spondents’ lawsuit. The taxpayers, then, must rely on an exception to the rule, an exception next to be considered.</p>
                <p pgmap="218" id="b218-4">B</p>
                <p pgmap="218" id="b218-5">The primary contention of respondents, of course, is that, despite the general rule that taxpayers lack standing to ob­ject to expenditures alleged to be unconstitutional, their suit falls within the exception established by Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83. It must be noted at the outset that, as this Court has explained, Flast’s holding provides a “narrow exception” to “the general rule against taxpayer standing.” Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 618 (1988).</p>
                <p pgmap="218" id="b218-6">At issue in Flast was the standing of federal taxpayers to object, on First Amendment grounds, to a congressional statute that allowed expenditures of federal funds from the General Treasury to support, among other programs, “in­struction in reading, arithmetic, and other subjects in reli­gious schools, and to purchase textbooks and other instruc­tional materials for use in such schools.” 392 U. S., at 85-86. Flast held that taxpayers have standing when two condi­tions are met.</p>
                <p pgmap="218(29) 219(135)" id="b218-7">The first condition is that there must be a “logical link” between the plaintiff’s taxpayer status “and the type of leg­islative enactment attacked.” Id., at 102. This condition was not satisfied in Doremus because the statute challenged in that case — providing for the recitation of Bible passages in public schools — involved at most an “incidental expendi­ture of tax funds.” Flast, 392 U. S., at 102. In Flast, by-­contrast, the allegation was that the Federal Government violated the Establishment Clause in the exercise of its legis­lative authority both to collect and spend tax dollars. Id., at 103. In the decades since Flast, the Court has been care­ful to enforce this requirement. See Hein, 551 U. S. 587 (no standing under Flast to challenge federal executive actions funded by general appropriations); Valley Forge, 454 U. S. 464 (no standing under Flast to challenge an agency’s deci­sion to transfer a parcel of federal property pursuant to the Property Clause).</p>
                <p pgmap="219" id="b219-5">The second condition for standing under Flast is that there must be “a nexus” between the plaintiff’s taxpayer status and “the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.” 392 U. S., at 102. This condition was deemed sat­isfied in Flast based on the allegation that Government funds had been spent on an outlay for religion in contravention of the Establishment Clause. Id., at 85-86. In Frothingkam, by contrast, the claim was that Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority without regard to any specific prohi­bition. 392 U. S., at 104-105. Confirming that Flast turned on the unique features of Establishment Clause violations, this Court has “declined to lower the taxpayer standing bar in suits alleging violations of any constitutional provision apart from the Establishment Clause.” Hein, supra, at 609 (plurality opinion); see also Richardson, 418 U. S. 166 (State­ment and Account Clause); Schlesinger, 418 U. S. 208 (Incom­patibility Clause).</p>
                <p pgmap="219(43) 220(118)" id="b219-6">After stating the two conditions for taxpayer standing, Flast considered them together, explaining that individu­als suffer a particular injury for standing purposes when, in violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of “the taxing and spending power,” their property is transferred through the Government's Treasury to a sectarian entity. 392 U. S., at 105-106. As Flast put it: “The taxpayer’s alle­gation in such cases would be that his tax money is being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional pro­tections against such abuses of legislative power.” Id., at 106. Flast thus “understood the 'injury’ alleged in Estab­lishment Clause challenges to federal spending to be the very ‘extraction] and spen[ding]’ of ‘tax money’ in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff.” DaimlerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 348 (quoting Flast, 392 U. S., at 106). “Such an injury,” Flast continued, is unlike “generalized grievances about the conduct of government” and so is “appropriate for judicial redress.” Ibid.</p>
                <p pgmap="220(210) 221(14)" id="b220-3">Flast found support for its finding of personal injury in “the history of the Establishment Clause,” particularly James Madison’s Memorial and Remonstrance Against Reli­gious Assessments. DaimlerChrysler, supra, at 348. In 1785, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Vir­ginia considered a “tax levy to support teachers of the Christian religion.” Flast, supra, at 104, n. 24; see A Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Reli­gion, reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 74 (1947) (supplemental appendix to dissent of Rut­ledge, J.). Under the proposed assessment bill, taxpayers would direct their payments to Christian societies of their choosing. Ibid. If a taxpayer made no such choice, the General Assembly was to divert his funds to “seminaries of learning,” at least some of which “undoubtedly would have been religious in character.” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 869, n. 1 (1995) (Sou­ter, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id., at 853, n. 1 (Thomas, J., concurring). However the “seminaries” provision might have functioned in practice, critics took the position that the proposed bill threatened compulsory religious contributions. See, e. g., T. Buckley, Church and State in Revolutionary Virginia, 1776-1787, pp. 133-134 (1977); H. Eckenrode, Separation of Church and State in Virginia 106-108 (1910).</p>
                <p pgmap="221" id="b221-5">In the Memorial and Remonstrance, Madison objected to the proposed assessment on the ground that it would coerce a form of religious devotion in violation of conscience. In Madison’s view, government should not “'force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment.’” Flast, supra, at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)). This Madisonian prohibition does not depend on the amount of property conscripted for sectarian ends. Any such tak­ing, even one amounting to “three pence only,” violates con­science. 392 U. S., at 103; cf. supra, at 134-135. The pro­posed bill ultimately died in committee; and the General Assembly instead enacted legislation forbidding “compelled” support of religion. See A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 2 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 545-546 (J. Boyd ed. 1950); see also Flast, 392 U. S., at 104, n. 24. Madison himself went on to become, as Flast put it, “the leading architect of the religion clauses of the First Amend­ment.” Id., at 103. Flast was thus informed by “the spe­cific evils” identified in the public arguments of “those who drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for its adop­tion.” Id., at 103-104; see also Feldman, Intellectual Ori­gins of the Establishment Clause, 77 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 346,351 (2002) (“[T]he Framers’ generation worried that conscience would be violated if citizens were required to pay taxes to support religious institutions with whose beliefs they dis­agreed”); McConnell, Coercion: The Lost Element of Estab­lishment, 27 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 933, 936-939 (1986).</p>
                <p pgmap="221" id="b221-6">Respondents contend that these principles demonstrate their standing to challenge the STO tax credit. In their view the tax credit is, for Flast purposes, best understood as a governmental expenditure. That is incorrect.</p>
                <p pgmap="221(20) 222(164)" id="b221-7">It is easy to see that tax credits and governmental expend­itures can have similar economic consequences, at least for beneficiaries whose tax liability is sufficiently large to take full advantage of the credit. Yet tax credits and govern­mental expenditures do not both implicate individual taxpay­ers in sectarian activities. A dissenter whose tax dollars are “extracted and spent” knows that he has in some small measure been made to contribute to an establishment in vio­lation of conscience. Flast, supra, at 106. In that instance the taxpayer’s direct and particular connection with the es­tablishment does not depend on economic speculation or po­litical conjecture. The connection would exist even if the conscientious dissenter’s tax liability were unaffected or re­duced. See Daimler Chrysler, supra, at 348-349. When the government declines to impose a tax, by contrast, there is no such connection between dissenting taxpayer and al­leged establishment. Any financial injury remains specula­tive. See supra, at 134-138. And awarding some citizens a tax credit allows other citizens to retain control over their own funds in accordance with their own consciences.</p>
                <p pgmap="222(176) 223(77)" id="b222-3">The distinction between governmental expenditures and tax credits refutes respondents’ assertion of standing. When Arizona taxpayers choose to contribute to STOs, they spend their own money, not money the State has collected from respondents or from other taxpayers. Arizona’s § 43-­1089 does not “extrac[t] and spen[d]” a conscientious dissent­er’s funds in service of an establishment, Flast, 392 U. S., at 106, or “ ‘force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property’ ” to a sectarian organization, id., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison, supra, at 186). On the contrary, respondents and other Arizona taxpayers remain free to pay their own tax bills, without contributing to an STO. Re­spondents are likewise able to contribute to an STO of their choice, either religious or secular. And respondents also have the option of contributing to other charitable organiza­tions, in which case respondents may become eligible for a tax deduction or a different tax credit. See, e. g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 43-1088 (West Supp. 2010). The STO tax credit is not tantamount to a religious tax or to a tithe and does not visit the injury identified in Flast. It follows that re­spondents have neither alleged an injury for standing pur­poses under general rules nor met the Flast exception. Finding standing under these circumstances would be more than the extension of Flast “to the limits of its logic.” Hein, 551U. S., at 615 (plurality opinion). It would he a departure from Flast's stated rationale.</p>
                <p pgmap="223" id="b223-5">Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the requirements of causation and redressability. When the government col­lects and spends taxpayer money, governmental choices are responsible for the transfer of wealth. In that case a result­ing subsidy of religious activity is, for purposes of Flast, traceable to the government’s expenditures. And an injunc­tion against those expenditures would address the objections of conscience raised by taxpayer-plaintiffs. See Daimler-­Chrysler, 547 U. S., at 344. Here, by contrast, contributions result from the decisions of private taxpayers regarding their own funds. Private citizens create private STOs; STOs choose beneficiary schools; and taxpayers then contrib­ute to STOs. While the State, at the outset, affords the op­portunity to create and contribute to an STO, the tax credit system is implemented by private action and with no state intervention. Objecting taxpayers know that their fellow citizens, not the State, decide to contribute and in fact make the contribution. These considerations prevent any injury the objectors may suffer from being fairly traceable to the government. And while an injunction against application of the tax credit most likely would reduce contributions to STOs, that remedy would not affect noncontributing taxpay­ers or their tax payments. As a result, any injury suffered by respondents would not be remedied by an injunction lim­iting the tax credit’s operation.</p>
                <p pgmap="223(29) 224(157)" id="b223-6">Resisting this conclusion, respondents suggest that Arizo­nans who benefit from § 43-1089 tax credits in effect are pay­ing their state income tax to STOs. In respondents’ view, tax credits give rise to standing even if tax deductions do not, since only the former yield a dollar-for-dollar reduction in final tax liability. See Brief for Respondent Winn et al. 5-6; Tr. of Oral Arg. 35-36. But what matters under Flast is whether sectarian STOs receive government funds drawn from general tax revenues, so that moneys have been ex­tracted from a citizen and handed to a religious institution in violation of the citizen’s conscience. Under that inquiry, respondents’ argument fails. Like contributions that lead to charitable tax deductions, contributions yielding STO tax credits are not owed to the State and, in fact, pass directly from taxpayers to private organizations. Respondents’ con­trary position assumes that income should be treated as if it were government property even if it has not come into the tax collector’s hands. .That premise finds no basis in standing jurisprudence. Private bank accounts cannot be equated with the Arizona state treasury.</p>
                <p pgmap="224(201) 225(58)" id="b224-3">The conclusion that the Flast exception is inapplicable at first may seem in tension with several earlier cases, all ad­dressing Establishment Clause issues and all decided after Flast. See Mueller, 463 U. S. 388; Committee for Public Ed. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756 (1973); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734 (1973); Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970); cf. Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (reaching only threshold jurisdictional issues). But those cases do not mention standing and so are not con­trary to the conclusion reached here. When a potential ju­risdictional defect is neither noted nor discussed in a federal decision, the decision does not stand for the proposition that no defect existed. See, e. g., Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 535, n. 5 (1974) (“[W]hen questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions sub silentio, this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us”); United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952) (“Even as to our own judicial power of jurisdiction, this Court has followed the lead of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall who held that this Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned and it was passed sub silentio”); Frothingkam, 262 U. S., at 486. The Court would risk error if it relied on assumptions that have gone unstated and unexamined.</p>
                <p pgmap="225" id="b225-4">Furthermore, if a law or practice, including a tax credit, disadvantages a particular religious group or a particular nonreligious group, the disadvantaged party would not have to rely on Flast to obtain redress for a resulting injury. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S., at 8 (plurality opin­ion) (finding standing where a general interest magazine sought to recover tax payments on the ground that religious periodicals were exempt from the tax). Because standing in Establishment Clause cases can be shown in various ways, it is far from clear that any nonbinding sub silentio holdings in the cases respondents cite would have depended on Flast. See, e. g., Walz, supra, at 666-667 (explaining that the plain­tiff was an “owner of real estate” in New York City who objected to the city’s issuance of “property tax exemptions to religious organizations”). That the plaintiffs in those cases could have advanced arguments for jurisdiction independent of Flast makes it particularly inappropriate to determine whether or why standing should have been found where the issue was left unexplored.</p>
                <p pgmap="225" id="b225-5">If an establishment of religion is alleged to cause real in­jury to particular individuals, the federal courts may adjudi­cate the matter. Like other constitutional provisions, the Establishment Clause acquires substance and meaning when explained, elaborated, and enforced in the context of actual disputes. That reality underlies the case-or-controversy re­quirement, a requirement that has not been satisfied here.</p>

                <p pgmap="225(20) 226(104)" id="b225-7">New exercises of the judicial power are more likely to un­dermine public confidence in the neutrality and integrity of the Judiciary than one which casts the Court in the role of a Council of Revision, conferring on itself the power to invali­date laws at the behest of anyone who disagrees with them. In an era of frequent litigation, class actions, sweeping in­junctions with prospective effect, and continuing jurisdiction to enforce judicial remedies, courts must be more careful to insist on the formal rules of standing, not less so. Making the Article III standing inquiry all the more necessary are the significant implications of constitutional litigation, which can result in rules of wide applicability that are beyond Con­gress’ power to change.</p>
                <p pgmap="226" id="b226-3">The present suit serves as an illustration of these princi­ples. The fact that respondents are state taxpayers does not give them standing to challenge the subsidies that § 43-­1089 allegedly provides to religious STOs. To alter the rules of standing or weaken their requisite elements would be inconsistent with the case-or-controversy limitation on federal jurisdiction imposed by Article III.</p>

                <p pgmap="226(108) 227(31)" id="b226-7">Taxpayers ordinarily do not have standing to challenge federal or state expenditures that allegedly violate the Con­stitution. See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 343-345 (2006). In Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968), we created a narrow exception for taxpayers raising Estab­lishment Clause challenges to government expenditures. Today’s majority and dissent struggle with whether respond­ents’ challenge to the Arizona tuition tax credit falls within that narrow exception. Under a principled reading of Arti­cle III, their struggles are unnecessary. Flast is an anomaly in our jurisprudence, irreconcilable with the Article III re­strictions on federal judicial power that our opinions have established. I would repudiate that misguided decision and enforce the Constitution. See Hein v. Freedom From Reli­gion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 618 (2007) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>
                <p pgmap="227" id="b227-4">I nevertheless join the Court’s opinion because it finds re­spondents lack standing by applying Flast rather than dis­tinguishing it away on unprincipled grounds. Cf. Hein, supra, at 628-631.</p>

                <p pgmap="227" id="b227-6">Since its inception, the Arizona private-school-tuition tax credit has cost the State, by its own estimate, nearly $350 million in diverted tax revenue. The Arizona taxpayers who instituted this suit (collectively, Plaintiffs) allege that the use of these funds to subsidize school tuition organiza­tions (STOs) breaches the Establishment Clause’s promise of religious neutrality. Many of these STOs, the Plaintiffs claim, discriminate on the basis of a child’s religion when awarding scholarships.</p>
                <p pgmap="227" id="b227-7">For almost half a century, litigants like the Plaintiffs have obtained judicial review of claims that the government has used its taxing and spending power in violation of the Estab­lishment Clause. Beginning in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968), and continuing in case after case for over four dec­ades, this Court and others have exercised jurisdiction to decide taxpayer-initiated challenges not materially different from this one. Not every suit has succeeded on the merits, or should have. But every taxpayer-plaintiff has had her day in court to contest the government’s financing of reli­gious activity.</p>
                <p pgmap="227(46) 228(37)" id="b227-8">Today, the Court breaks from this precedent by refusing to hear taxpayers’ claims that the government has unconsti­tutionally subsidized religion through its tax system. These litigants lack standing, the majority holds, because the fund­ing of religion they challenge comes from a tax credit, rather than an appropriation. A tax credit, the Court asserts, does not injure objecting taxpayers, because it “does not extract and spend [their] funds in service of an establishment.” Ante, at 142 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>
                <p pgmap="228" id="b228-3">This novel distinction in standing law between appro­priations and tax expenditures has as little basis in principle as it has in our precedent. Cash grants and targeted tax breaks are means of accomplishing the same government objective — to provide financial support to select individuals or organizations. Taxpayers who oppose state aid of reli­gion have equal reason to protest whether that aid flows from the one form of subsidy or the other. Either way, the government has financed the religious activity. And so either way, taxpayers should be able to challenge the subsidy.</p>
                <p pgmap="228" id="b228-4">Still worse, the Court’s arbitrary distinction threatens to eliminate all occasions for a taxpayer to contest the govern­ment’s monetary support of religion. Precisely because ap­propriations and tax breaks can achieve identical objectives, the government can easily substitute one for the other. To­day’s opinion thus enables the government to end-run Flast’s guarantee of access to the Judiciary. From now on, the gov­ernment need follow just one simple rule — subsidize through the tax system — to preclude taxpayer challenges to state funding of religion.</p>
                <p pgmap="228" id="b228-5">And that result — the effective demise of taxpayer stand­ing — will diminish the Establishment Clause’s force and meaning. Sometimes, no one other than taxpayers has suf­fered the injury necessary to challenge government spon­sorship of religion. Today’s holding therefore will prevent federal courts from determining whether some subsidies to sectarian organizations comport with our Constitution’s guarantee of religious neutrality. Because I believe these challenges warrant consideration on the merits, I respect­fully dissent from the Court’s decision.</p>
                <p pgmap="229" id="Aum">I</p>
                <p pgmap="229" id="b229-3">As the majority recounts, this Court has held that paying taxes usually does not give an individual Article III standing to challenge government action. Ante, at 133-138. Tax­payers cannot demonstrate the requisite injury because each person’s “interest in the moneys of the Treasury ... is com­paratively minute and indeterminable.” Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 487 (1923) (decided with Massachu­setts v. Mellon). Given the size and complexity of govern­ment budgets, it is a “fiction” to contend that an unlawful expenditure causes an individual “any measurable economic harm.” Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 593 (2007) (plurality opinion). Nor can tax­payers in the ordinary case establish causation (i. e., that the disputed government measure affects their tax burden) or redressability (i. e., that a judicial remedy would result in tax reductions). Ante, at 136. On these points, all agree.</p>
                <p pgmap="229" id="b229-4">The disagreement concerns their relevance here. This case is not about the general prohibition on taxpayer stand­ing, and cannot be resolved on that basis. This case is instead about the exception to the rule — the principle estab­lished decades ago in Flast that taxpayers may challenge certain government actions alleged to violate the Establish­ment Clause. The Plaintiffs have standing if their suit meets Flasts requirements — and it does so under any fair reading of that decision.</p>
                <p pgmap="229(94) 230(96)" id="b229-5">Taxpayers have standing, Flast held, when they allege that a statute enacted pursuant to the legislature’s taxing and spending power violates the Establishment Clause. 392 U. S., at 105-106. In this situation, the Court explained, a plaintiff can establish a two-part nexus “between the [tax­payer] status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudi­cated.” Id., at 102. First, by challenging legislative action taken under the taxing and spending clause, the taxpayer shows “a logical link between [her] status and the type of . . . enactment attacked.” Ibid. Second, by invoking the Establishment Clause — a specific limitation on the legisla­ture’s taxing and spending power — the taxpayer demon­strates “a nexus between [her] status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.” Ibid. Because of these connections, Flast held, taxpayers alleging that the government is using tax proceeds to aid religion have “the necessary stake ... in the outcome of the litigation to satisfy Article III.” Ibid. They are “proper and appropriate par­ties]” — indeed, often the only possible parties — to seek judi­cial enforcement of the Constitution’s guarantee of religious neutrality. Ibid.</p>
                <p pgmap="230" id="b230-3">That simple restatement of the Flast standard should be enough to establish that the Plaintiffs have standing. They attack a provision of the Arizona tax code that the legis­lature enacted pursuant to the State Constitution’s taxing and spending clause (Flast nexus, part 1). And they allege that this provision violates the Establishment Clause (Flast nexus, part 2). By satisfying both of Flast’s conditions, the Plaintiffs have demonstrated their “stake as taxpayers” in enforcing constitutional restraints on the provision of aid to STOs. Ibid. Indeed, the connection in this case be­tween “the [taxpayer] status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated,” ibid., could not be any tighter: As noted when this Court previously addressed a different issue in this lawsuit, the Plaintiffs invoke the Establishment Clause to challenge “an integral part of the State’s tax statute” that “is reflected on state tax forms” and that “is part of the calculus necessary to determine tax liability.” Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 119 (2004) (Winn I) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). Finding standing here is merely a matter of applying Flast. I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals’ determination (not questioned even by the eight judges who called for rehearing en banc on the merits) that the Plaintiffs can pursue their claim in federal court.</p>
                <p pgmap="231" id="AC">II</p>
                <p pgmap="231" id="b231-3">The majority reaches a contrary decision by distinguishing between two methods of financing religion: A taxpayer has standing to challenge state subsidies to religion, the Court announces, when the mechanism used is an appropriation, but not when the mechanism is a targeted tax break, other­wise called a “tax expenditure.”<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the former case, but not in the latter, the Court declares, the taxpayer suffers cognizable injury. Ante, at 141-143.</p>
                <p pgmap="231(114) 232(55)" id="b231-4">But this distinction finds no support in case law, and just as little in reason. In the decades since Flast, no court— not one — has differentiated between appropriations and tax expenditures in deciding whether litigants have standing. Over and over again, courts (including this one) have faced Establishment Clause challenges to tax credits, deductions, and exemptions; over and over again, these courts have reached the merits of these claims. And that is for a simple reason: Taxpayers experience the same injury for standing purposes whether government subsidization of religion takes the form of a cash grant or a tax measure. The only ration­ale the majority offers for its newfound distinction — that grants, but not tax expenditures, somehow come from a com­plaining taxpayer’s own wallet — cannot bear the weight the Court places on it. If Flast is still good law — and the major­ity today says nothing to the contrary — then the Plaintiffs should be able to pursue their claim on the merits.</p>
                <p pgmap="232" id="b232-3">A</p>
                <p pgmap="232(108) 233(13)" id="b232-4">Until today, this Court has never so much as hinted that litigants in the same shoes as the Plaintiffs lack standing under Flast. To the contrary: We have faced the identical situation five times — including in a prior incarnation of this very case! — and we have five times resolved the suit -without questioning the plaintiffs’ standing. Lower federal courts have followed our example and handled the matter in the same way. I count 14 separate cases (involving 20 appellate and district courts) that adjudicated taxpayer challenges to tax expenditures alleged to violate the Establishment Clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I suspect I have missed a few. I have not found any instance of a court dismissing such a claim for lack of standing.</p>
                <p pgmap="233(215) 234(27)" id="b233-5">Consider the five cases in which this Court entertained suits filed by taxpayers alleging that tax expenditures un­lawfully subsidized religion. We first took up such a chal­lenge in Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 666-667 (1970), where we upheld the constitutionality of a property tax exemption for religious organizations. Next, in Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 735-736, 738-739 (1973), we decided that the Establishment Clause permitted a state agency to issue tax-exempt bonds to sectarian institutions. The same day, in Committee for Public Ed. &amp; Religious Lib­erty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 789-794 (1973), we struck down a state tax deduction for parents who paid tuition at religious and other private schools. A decade later, in Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 390-391 (1983), we consid­ered, but this time rejected, a similar Establishment Clause challenge to a state tax deduction for expenses incurred in attending such schools. And most recently, we decided a preliminary issue in this very case, ruling that the Tax In­junction Act, 28 U. S. C. § 1341, posed no barrier to the Plain­tiffs’ litigation of their Establishment Clause claim. See Winn I, 542 U. S., at 112.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court in all five of these cases divided sharply on the merits of the disputes. But in one respect, the Justices were unanimous: Not a single one thought to question the litigants’ standing.</p>
                <p pgmap="234" id="b234-3">The Solicitor General, participating here as amicus curiae, conceded at oral argument that under the Federal Govern­ment’s — and now the Court’s — view of taxpayer standing, each of these five cases should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
                <blockquote pgmap="234" id="b234-4">“[The Court]: So if you are right, . . . the Court was without authority to decide Walz, Nyquist, Hunt, Muel­ler, [and] Hibbs [v. Winn], this very case, just a few years ago? ...</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="234" id="b234-5">[Solicitor General]: Right.... [M]y answer to you is yes.</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="234" id="ATX">(The Court]: I just want to make sure I heard your answer to the — you said the answer is yes. In other words, you agree . . . those cases were wrongly decided. . . . [Y]ou would have said there would have been no standing in those cases.</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="234" id="b234-6">[Solicitor General]: No taxpayer standing.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 10-12 (some paragraph breaks omitted).</blockquote>
                <p pgmap="234" id="b234-7">Nor could the Solicitor General have answered differently. Each of these suits, as described above, alleged that a state tax expenditure violated the Establishment Clause. And each relied only on taxpayer standing as the basis for federal-court review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court today speculates that “the plaintiffs in those cases could have advanced arguments for jurisdiction independent of Flast.” Ante, at 145. But whatever could have been, in fact not one of them did so.</p>
                <p pgmap="234(21) 235(265)" id="b234-8">And the Court itself understood the basis of standing in these five cases. This and every federal court has an inde­pendent obligation to consider standing, even when the par­ties do not call it into question. See, e. g., FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 230-231 (1990). To do anything else would risk an unlawful exercise of judicial authority. And in these cases the Court had an additional prompt: In several of them, amici, including the United States, contested — or at least raised as a question — the plaintiffs’ standing as tax­payers to pursue their claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court, moreover, was well aware at the time of the issues presented by taxpayer standing. We decided three of the cases within a year of elaborating the general bar on taxpayer suits, see, e.g., United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166 (1974); Schle­singer v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208 (1974), and the fourth just after we held that bar applicable to a different kind of Establishment Clause claim, see Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separa­tion of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464 (1982). Indeed, the decisions on their face reflect the Court’s recognition of what gave the plaintiffs standing; in each, we specifically de­scribed the plaintiffs as taxpayers who challenged the use of the tax system to fund religious activities. See Winn I, 542 U. S., at 94; Mueller, 463 U. S., at 392; Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 759, 762; Hunt, 413 U. S., at 735-736; Walz, 397 U. S., at 666-­667. In short, we considered and decided all these cases be­cause we thought taxpayer standing existed.</p>
                <p pgmap="235(50) 236(285)" id="b235-5">The majority shrugs off these decisions because they did not discuss what was taken as obvious. Ante, at 144-145. But we have previously stressed that the Court should not “disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial author­ity assumed to be proper for over 40 years.” Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962); see Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 619 (1988) (finding standing partly because the Court, in deciding similar cases, had “not ques­tioned the standing of taxpayer plaintiffs to raise Establish­ment Clause challenges”); Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (1809) (Marshall, C. J.) (prior decisions exer­cising but not discussing jurisdiction “have much weight, as they show that [a jurisdictional flaw] neither occurred to the bar or the bench”). And that principle has extra force here, because we have relied on some of these decisions to support the Court’s jurisdiction in other cases. Pause on that for a moment: The very decisions the majority today so easily dismisses are featured in our prior cases as exemplars of jurisdiction. So in School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985), we relied on Nyquist and Hunt to con­clude that taxpayers had standing to challenge a program of aid to religious and other private schools. 473 U. S., at 380, n. 5, overruled in part on other grounds by Agostini v. Fel­ton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997). And in Winn I (recall, an earlier iteration of this case), we rejected a different jurisdictional objection in part by relying on Mueller and Nyquist. We called those eases “adjudications of great moment discerning no [jurisdictional] barrier” and warned that they could not “be written off as reflecting nothing more than unexamined custom or unthinking habit.” 542 U. S., at 112, n. 13 (inter­nal quotation marks and citations omitted). Until today, that is — when the majority does write off these adjudications and reaches a result against all precedent.</p>

                <p pgmap="236(57) 237(152)" id="b236-4">Our taxpayer standing cases have declined to distinguish between appropriations and tax expenditures for a simple reason: Here, as in many contexts, the distinction is one in search of a difference. To begin to see why, consider an ex­ample far afield from Flast and, indeed, from religion. Imagine that the Federal Government decides it should pay hundreds of billions of dollars to insolvent banks in the midst of a financial crisis. Suppose, too, that many millions of tax­payers oppose this bailout on the ground (whether right or wrong is immaterial) that it uses their hard-earned money to reward irresponsible business behavior. In the face of this hostility, some Members of Congress make the following proposal: Rather than give the money to banks via appropri­ations, the Government will allow banks to subtract the exact same amount from the tax bill they would otherwise have to pay to the U. S. Treasury. Would this proposal calm the furor? Or would most taxpayers respond by saying that a subsidy is a subsidy (or a bailout is a bailout), whether accomplished by the one means or by the other? Surely the latter; indeed, we would think the less of our countrymen if they failed to see through this cynical proposal.</p>
                <p pgmap="237(206) 238(21)" id="b237-4">And what ordinary people would appreciate, this Court’s case law also recognizes — that targeted tax breaks are often “economically and functionally indistinguishable from a di­rect monetary subsidy.” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visi­tors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 859 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring). Tax credits, deductions, and exemptions pro­vided to an individual or organization have “much the same effect as a cash grant to the [recipient] of the amount of tax it would have to pay” absent the tax break. Regan v. Taxa­tion With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 544 (1983). “Our opinions,” therefore, “have long recognized... the real­ity that [tax expenditures] are a form of subsidy that is ad­ministered through the tax system.” Arkansas Writers’ Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 236 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). Or again: Tax breaks “can be viewed as a form of government spend­ing,” Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Har­rison, 520 U. S. 564, 589-590, n. 22 (1997), even assuming the diverted tax funds do not pass through the public treasury. And once more: Both special tax benefits and cash grants “represent] a charge made upon the state,” Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 790-791 (internal quotation marks omitted); both deplete funds in the government's coffers by transferring money to select recipients.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>

                <p pgmap="238(241) 239(22)" id="b238-3">For just this reason, government budgeting rules rou­tinely insist on calculation of tax subsidies, in addition to appropriations. The President must provide information on the estimated cost of tax expenditures in the budget he sub­mits to Congress each year. See 31 U. S. C. § 1105(a)(16); n. 1, supra. Similarly, congressional budget committees must report to all Members on the level of tax expenditures in the federal budget. See 2 U. S. C. § 632(e)(2)(E). Many States — including Arizona — likewise compute the impact of targeted tax breaks on the public treasury, in recognition that these measures are just spending under a different name, see n. 1, supra. The Arizona Department of Revenue must issue an annual report “detailing the approximate costs in lost revenue for all state tax expenditures.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 42-1005(A)(4) (West 2006). The most recent re­port notes the significance of this accounting in the budget process. It explains that “the fiscal impact of implement­ing” targeted tax breaks, including the STO credit chal­lenged here, is “similar to a direct expenditure of state funds.” Arizona Dept, of Revenue, Revenue Impact of Ari­zona’s Tax Expenditures FY 2009/10, p. 1 (preliminary Nov. 15, 2010); see also Surrey, Tax Incentives as a Device for Implementing Government Policy: A Comparison With Di­rect Government Expenditures, 83 Harv.

                <p pgmap="239" id="b239-5">And because these financing mechanisms result in the same bottom line, taxpayers challenging them can allege the same harm. Our prior cases have often recognized the cost that targeted tax breaks impose on taxpayers generally. “When the Government grants exemptions or allows deduc­tions” to some, we have observed, “all taxpayers are af­fected; the very fact of the exemption or deduction... means that other taxpayers can be said to be indirect and vicarious ‘donors.’ ” Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S. 574, 591 (1983). And again: “Every tax exemption constitutes a subsidy that affects nonqualifying taxpayers, forcing them to” bear its cost. Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S. 1, 14 (1989) (plurality opinion). Indeed, we have specifically compared the harm arising from a tax subsidy with that aris­ing from a cash grant, and declared those injuries equivalent because both kinds of support deplete the public fisc. “In either case,” we stated, “the alleged injury is based on the asserted effect of the allegedly illegal activity on public reve­nues, to which the taxpayer contributes.” DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 344 (2006). This taxpayer in­jury of course fails to establish standing in the mine-run case, whatever form the state aid takes. See, e. g., id., at 343-344; ante, at 133-138; supra, at 149. But the key is this: Whenever taxpayers have standing under Flast to challenge an appro­priation, they should also have standing to contest a tax ex­penditure. Their access to the federal courts should not de­pend on which type of financial subsidy the State has offered.</p>
                <p pgmap="239(74) 240(131)" id="b239-6">Consider some further examples of the point, but this time concerning state funding of religion. Suppose a State de­sires to reward Jews — by, say, $500 per year — for their reli­gious devotion. Should the nature of taxpayers’ concern vary if the State allows Jews to claim the aid on their tax returns, in lieu of receiving an annual stipend? Or assume a State wishes to subsidize the ownership of crucifixes. It could purchase the religious symbols in bulk and distribute them to all takers. Or it could mail a reimbursement check to any individual who buys her own and submits a receipt for the purchase. Or it could authorize that'person to claim a tax credit equal to the price she paid. Now, really — do taxpayers have less reason to complain if the State selects the last of these three options? The Court today says they do, but that is wrong. The effect of each form of subsidy is the same, on the public fisc and on those who contribute to it. Regardless of which mechanism the State uses, taxpay­ers have an identical stake in ensuring that the State’s exer­cise of its taxing and spending power complies with the Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>

                <p pgmap="240(171) 241(113)" id="b240-3">Here, the mechanism Arizona has selected is a dollar-for-­dollar tax credit to aid STOs. Each year come April 15, the State tells Arizonans: Either pay the full amount of your tax liability to the State, or subtract up to $500 from your tax bill by contributing that sum to an STO. See Winn I, 542 U. S., at 95. To claim the credit, an individual makes a nota­tion on her tax return and splits her tax payment into two checks, one made out to the State and the other to the STO. As this Court recognized in Winn I, the STO payment is therefore “costless” to the individual, ibid.; it comes out of what she otherwise would be legally obligated to pay the State — hence, out of public resources. And STOs capitalize on this aspect of the tax credit for all it is worth — which is quite a lot. To drum up support, STOs highlight that “do­nations” are made not with an individual’s own, but with other people’s — i. e., taxpayers’ — money. One STO adver­tises that “[w]ith Arizona’s scholarship tax credit, you can send children to our community’s [religious] day schools and it won’t cost you a dime!” Brief for Respondents 13 (inter­nal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). Another urges potential donors to “imagine giving [to charity] with someone else’s money.... Stop Imagining, thanks to Arizona tax laws you can!” Id., at 14 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). And so Arizonans do just that: It is, after all, good fun to spend other people’s money. By the State’s reckoning, from 1998 to 2008 the credit cost Arizona almost $350 million in redirected tax revenue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>
                </p>
                <p pgmap="241" id="b241-5">The Plaintiffs contend that this expenditure violates the Establishment Clause. If the legislature had appropriated these monies for STOs, the Plaintiffs would have standing, beyond any dispute, to argue the merits of their claim in federal court. But the Plaintiffs have no such recourse, the Court today holds, because Arizona funds STOs through a tax credit rather than a cash grant. No less than in the hypothetical examples offered above, here too form prevails over substance, and differences that make no difference determine access to the Judiciary. And the casualty is a his­toric and vital method of enforcing the Constitution’s guaran­tee of religious neutrality.</p>

                <p pgmap="241(16) 242(118)" id="b241-7">The majority offers just one reason to distinguish appro­priations and tax expenditures: A taxpayer experiences injury, the Court asserts, only when the government “ex­tracts and spends” her very own tax dollars to aid religion. Ante, at 142 (internal quotation marks and alterations omit­ted). In other words, a taxpayer suffers legally cognizable harm if but only if her particular tax dollars wind up in a religious organization’s coffers. See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 4 (Solicitor General proposing that the “key point” was: “If you placed an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the [Plaintiffs] pay in tax,” none goes to religious STOs). And no taxpayer can make this showing, the Court con­cludes, if the government subsidizes religion through tax credits, deductions, or exemptions (rather than through appropriations).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>
                </p>
                <p pgmap="242(60) 243(76)" id="b242-3">The majority purports to rely on Flast to support this new “extraction” requirement. It plucks the three words “ex-­trac[t] and spen[d]” from the midst of the Flast opinion, and suggests that they severely constrict the decision’s scope. Ante, at 142 (quoting 392 U. S., at 106). And it notes that Flast partly relied on James Madison’s famed argument in the Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assess­ments: “ ‘[T]he same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever.’ ” 392 U. S., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 183,186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)); see ante, at 139-141. And that is all the majority can come up with.</p>
                <p pgmap="243(270) 244(12)" id="b243-5">But as indicated earlier, everything of import in Flast cuts against the majority’s position. Here is how Flast stated its holding: “[W]e hold that a taxpayer will have standing consistent with Article III to invoke federal judicial power when he alleges that congressional action under the taxing and spending clause is in derogation of” the Establishment Clause. 392 U. S., at 105-106. Nothing in that straightfor­ward sentence supports the idea that a taxpayer can chal­lenge only legislative action that disburses his particular contribution to the state treasury. And here is how Flast primarily justified its holding: “[0]ne of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption was that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion in general.” Id., at 103. That evil arises even if the specific dollars that the government uses do not come from citizens who object to the preference. Likewise, the two-part nexus test, which is the heart of Flastfs doctrinal analysis, contains no hint of an extraction requirement. See supra, at 149-150. And finally, James Madison provides no comfort to today’s majority. He re­ferred to “three pence” exactly because it was, even in 1785, a meaningless sum of money; then, as today, the core injury of a religious establishment had naught to do with any given individual’s out-of-pocket loss. See infra, at 166-168 (fur­ther discussing Madison’s views). So the majority is left with nothing, save for three words Flast used to describe the particular facts in that case: In not a single non-trivial respect could the Flast Court recognize its handiwork in the majority’s depiction.</p>
                <p pgmap="244" id="b244-3">The injury to taxpayers that Flast perceived arose when­ever the legislature used its taxing and spending power to channel tax dollars to religious activities. In that and sub­sequent cases (including the five in this Court involving tax expenditures), a taxpayer pleaded the requisite harm by stating that public resources were funding religion; the trac­ing of particular dollars (whether by the Solicitor General’s “electronic tag” or other means) did not enter into the ques­tion. See DaimlerChrysler Corp., 547 U. S., at 348 (de­scribing how the Flast Court’s understanding of the Estab­lishment Clause’s history led the Court to view the alleged “injury” as the expenditure of “ 'tax money’ in aid of reli­gion” (quoting Flast, 392 U. S., at 106)). And for all the rea­sons already given, that standard is met regardless whether the funding is provided via cash grant or tax expenditure. See supra, at 156-161. Taxpayers pick up the cost of the subsidy in either form. See ibid. So taxpayers have an in­terest in preventing the use of either mechanism to infringe religious neutrality.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>
                </p>
                <p pgmap="245" id="A3n8">Indeed, the majority’s new conception of injury is at odds not merely with Flast, but also (if ironically) with our cases precluding taxpayer standing generally. See supra, at 149; ante, at 134-138. Today’s majority insists that legislation challenged under the Establishment Clause must “extrac[t] and spen[d] a conscientious dissenter’s funds.” Ante, at 142. But we have rejected taxpayer standing in other contexts because each taxpayer’s share of treasury funds is “minute and indeterminable.” Frothingham, 262 U. S., at 487. No taxpayer can point to an expenditure (by cash grant or other­wise) and sáy that her own tax dollars are in the mix; in fact, they almost surely are not. “[I]t is,” as we have noted, “a complete fiction to argue that an unconstitutional. . . ex­penditure causes an individual. . . taxpayer any measurable economic harm.” Hein, 551 U. S., at 593 (plurality opinion). That is as true in Establishment Clause cases as in any oth­ers. Taxpayers have standing in these cases despite then-­foreseeable failure to show that the alleged constitutional vi­olation involves their own tax dollars, not because the State has used their particular funds.</p>
                <p pgmap="245(108) 246(121)" id="b245-4">And something still deeper is wrong with the majority’s “extract and spend” requirement: It does not measure what matters under the Establishment Clause. Let us indulge the Court’s fiction that a taxpayer’s “.000000000001 penny” is somehow involved in an ordinary appropriation of public funds for religious activity (thus supposedly distinguishing it from a tax expenditure). Still, consider the following ex­ample: Imagine the Internal Revenue Service places a check-­box on tax returns asking filers if they object to the govern­ment using their taxes to aid religion. If the government keeps “yes” money separate from “no” money and subsidizes religious activities only from the nonobjectors’ account, the majority’s analysis suggests that no taxpayer would have standing to allege a violation of the Establishment Clause. The funds used, after all, would not have been “extracted from a citizen and handed to a religious institution in viola­tion of the citizen’s conscience.” Ante, at 144. But this Court has never indicated that States may insulate subsidies to religious organizations from legal challenge by eliciting the consent of some taxpayers. And the Court has of course been right not to take this approach. Taxpayers incur the same harm, and should have the same ability to bring suit, whether the government stores tax funds in one bank ac­count or two. None of the principles underlying the Estab­lishment Clause suggests otherwise.</p>
                <p pgmap="246(140) 247(152)" id="b246-3">James Madison, whom the Court again rightly labels “the leading architect of the religion clauses,” ante, at 141 (quot­ing Flast, 392 U. S., at 103; internal quotation marks omit­ted), had something important to say about the matter of “extraction.” As the majority notes, Madison’s Memorial and Remonstrance criticized a tax levy proposed in Virginia to aid teachers of the Christian religion. Ante, at 140-141. But Madison’s passionate opposition to that proposal informs this case in a manner different than the majority suggests. The Virginia tax in fact would not have extracted any monies (not even “three pence”) from unwilling citizens; as the Court now requires. The plan allowed conscientious objec­tors to opt out of subsidizing religion by contributing their assessment to an alternative fund for the construction and maintenance of county schools.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See A Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion, reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 74 (1947) (supplemental appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.); Letter From James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (Jan. 9, 1785), re­printed in 2 Writings of James Madison, at 102,113; see also Blasi, School Vouchers and Religious Liberty: Seven Ques­tions from Madison’s Memorial and Remonstrance, 87 Cor­nell L. Rev. 783, 784 (2002) (the tax provision “permitted each taxpayer to specify which Christian denomination should receive his payment” and “[tjhose who did not wish to support a church could direct their assessment to a proposed common school fund”). Indeed, the Virginia as­sessment was specifically “designed to avoid any charges of coercion of dissenters to pay taxes to support religious teachings with which they disagreed.” Feldman, Intellec­tual Origins of the Establishment Clause, 77 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 346, 383 (2002).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>
                </p>
                <p pgmap="248" id="b248-2">In this respect, the Virginia Assessment is just like the Arizona tax credit. Although both funnel tax funds to reli­gious organizations (and so saddle all taxpayers with the cost), neither forces any given taxpayer to pay for the sub­sidy out of her pocket. Madison thought that feature of the Assessment insufficient to save it. By relying on the self­same aspect of the Arizona scheme to deny the Plaintiffs’ claim of injury, the majority betrays Madison’s vision.</p>
                <p pgmap="248" id="b248-3">Ill</p>
                <p pgmap="248" id="b248-4">Today’s decision devastates taxpayer standing in Estab­lishment Clause cases. The government, after all, often uses tax expenditures to subsidize favored persons and activ­ities. Still more, the government almost always has this option. Appropriations and tax subsidies are readily inter­changeable; what is a cash grant today can be a tax break tomorrow. The Court’s opinion thus offers a roadmap— more truly, just a one-step instruction — to any government that wishes to insulate its financing of religious activity from legal challenge. Structure the funding as a tax ex­penditure, and Flast will not stand in the way. No tax­payer will have standing to object. However blatantly the government may violate the Establishment Clause, tax­payers cannot gain access to the federal courts.</p>
                <p pgmap="248(67) 249(135)" id="b248-5">And by ravaging Flast in this way, today’s decision damages one of this Nation’s defining constitutional commit­ments. “Congress shall make no law respecting an estab­lishment of religion” — ten simple words that have stood for over 200 years as a foundation stone of American religious liberty. Ten words that this Court has long understood, as James Madison did, to limit (though by no means eliminate) the government’s power to finance religious activity. The Court’s ruling today will not shield all state subsidies for religion from review; as the Court notes, some persons alleg­ing Establishment Clause violations have suffered individu­alized injuries, and therefore have standing, independent of their taxpayer status. See ante, at 129-130, 145. But Flast arose because “the taxing and spending power [may] be used to favor one religion over another or to support reli­gion in general,” 392 U. S., at 103, without causing particu­larized harm to discrete persons. It arose because state sponsorship of religion sometimes harms individuals only (but this “only” is no small matter) in their capacity as con­tributing members of our national community. In those cases, the Flast Court thought, our Constitution’s guarantee of religious neutrality still should be enforced.</p>
                <p pgmap="249" id="b249-5">Because that judgment was right then, and remains right today, I respectfully dissent.</p>

Arizona’s tuition-tax-­credit program in fact necessitates the direct expenditure of funds from the state treasury. After all, the statute establishing the initiative re­quires the Arizona Department of Revenue to certify STOs, maintain an STO registry, make the registry available to the public on request and post it on a website, collect annual reports filed by STOs, and send written notice to STOs that have failed to comply with statutory requirements. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§43-1502(A)-(C), 43-1506 (West Supp. 2010). Pre­sumably all these activities cost money, which comes from the state treas­ury. Thus, on the majority’s own theory, the government has “extract[ed] and spen[t]” the Plaintiffs’ (along with other taxpayers’) dollars to imple­ment the challenged program, and the Plaintiffs should have standing. (The majority, after all, makes clear that nothing in its analysis hinges on the size or proportion of the Plaintiffs’ contribution. Ante, at 141.) But applying the majority’s theory in this way reveals the hollowness at its core. Can anyone believe that the Plaintiffs have suffered injury through the costs involved in administering the program, but not through the far greater costs of granting the tax expenditure in the first place?</p>

                  <p pgmap="244(191) 245(36)" id="b244-4">10 On this traditional view of the harm to taxpayers arising from state financing of religion, the Plaintiffs here can satisfy not only Article Ill’s injury requirement, but also its causation and redressability requirements. The majority’s contrary position, ante, at 143, stems from its miscasting of the injury involved; once that harm is stated correctly, all the rest follows. To wit: The Plaintiffs allege they suffer injury when the State funnels public resources to religious organizations through the tax credit. Arizona, they claim, has caused this injury by enacting legisla­tion that establishes the credit. And an injunction limiting the credit’s operation would redress the harm by preventing the allegedly unlawful diversion of tax revenues. The Plaintiffs need not, as the majority insists, show that this remedy would “affect . . . their tax payments,” ibid.; any more than the taxpayer in Flast had to establish that her tax burden would decrease absent the Government’s funding of religious schools. As we have previously recognized, when taxpayers object to the spend­ing of tax money in violation of the Establishment Clause (whether through tax credits or appropriations), “an injunction against the spending would . . . redress [their] injury, regardless of whether lawmakers would dispose of the savings in a way that would benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs personally.” Daimler Chrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 348-349 (2006).</p>

Ante, at 140. Because the Assessment never became law, no one can know which county schools would have re­ceived aid; indeed, the first of these schools did not open its doors until decades later. See W. Miller, First Liberty 26 (2003); see generally J. Buck, Development of Public Schools in Virginia 1607-1952 (1952). But historians and legal scholars have uniformly understood the opt-out provi­sion as a considered attempt to accommodate taxpayers who did not want their tax dollars to go to religion. See Berg &amp; Laycock, supra, at 244, n. 113 (the “provision for payment to a school fund was not an effort to support religious schools as part of support for education overall,” but rather “was an effort to accommodate the possibility of non-Christian tax­payers”); T. Buckley, Church and State in Revolutionary Virginia, 1776-­1787, p. 133 (1977) (under the “text of the proposed bill . . . nonbelievers would [not] be forced to contribute to religion” because “[t]he assessment had been carefully drafted to permit those who preferred to support edu­cation rather than religion to do so”); see also, e. g., Miller, supra, at 26; Underkuffler-Freund, Separation of the Religious and the Secular: A Foundational Challenge to First Amendment Theory, 36 Wm. &amp; Mary L.
