                <author pgmap="535" id="b535-4">Justice Alito</author>
                <p pgmap="535" id="ANq">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
                <p pgmap="535" id="b535-5">It is well established that “exigent circumstances,” includ­ing the need to prevent the destruction of evidence, permit police officers to conduct an otherwise permissible search without first obtaining a warrant. In this case, we consider whether this rule applies when police, by knocking on the door of a residence and announcing their presence, cause the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence. The Kentucky Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances rule does not apply in the case at hand because the police should have foreseen that their conduct would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence. We reject this interpreta­tion of the exigent circumstances rule. The conduct of the police prior to their entry into the apartment was entirely lawful. They did not violate the Fourth Amendment or threaten to do so. In such a situation, the exigent circum­stances rule applies.</p>
                <p pgmap="535" id="b535-6">I</p>
                <p pgmap="535" id="b535-7">A</p>
                <p pgmap="535(27) 536(68)" id="b535-8">This case concerns the search of an apartment in Lexing­ton, Kentucky. Police officers set up a controlled buy of crack cocaine outside an apartment complex. Undercover Officer Gibbons watched the deal take place from an un­marked car in a nearby parking lot. After the deal oc­curred, Gibbons radioed uniformed officers to move in on the suspect. He told the officers that the suspect was moving quickly toward the breezeway of an apartment building, and he urged them to “hurry up and get there” before the sus­pect entered an apartment. App. 20.</p>
                <p pgmap="536" id="b536-5">In response to the radio alert, the uniformed officers drove into the nearby parking lot, left their vehicles, and ran to the breezeway. Just as they entered the breezeway, they heard a door shut and detected a very strong odor of burnt mari­juana. At the end of the breezeway, the officers saw two apartments, one on the left and one on the right, and they did not know which apartment the suspect had entered. Gibbons had radioed that the suspect was running into the apartment on the right, but the officers did not hear this statement because they had already left their vehicles. Be­cause they smelled marijuana smoke emanating from the apartment on the left, they approached the door of that apartment.</p>
                <p pgmap="536" id="b536-6">Officer Steven Cobb, one of the uniformed officers who ap­proached the door, testified that the officers banged on the left apartment door “as loud as [they] could” and announced, “ ‘This is the police’ ” or “ ‘Police, police, police.’ ” Id., at 22-­23. Cobb said that “[a]s soon as [the officers] started bang­ing on the door,” they “could hear people inside moving,” and “[i]t sounded as [though] things were being moved inside the apartment.” Id., at 24. These noises, Cobb testified, led the officers to believe that drug-related evidence was about to be destroyed.</p>
                <p pgmap="536(48) 537(35)" id="b536-7">At that point, the officers announced that they “were going to make entry inside the apartment.” Ibid. Cobb then kicked in the door, the officers entered the apartment, and they found three people in the front room: respondent Hollis King, respondent’s girlfriend, and a guest who was smoking marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The officers performed a protective sweep of the apartment during which they saw marijuana and powder cocaine in plain view. In a subsequent search, they also dis­covered crack cocaine, cash, and drug paraphernalia.</p>
                <p pgmap="537" id="b537-5">Police eventually entered the apartment on the right. In­side, they found the suspected drug dealer who was the ini­tial target of their investigation.</p>
                <p pgmap="537" id="b537-6">B</p>
                <p pgmap="537" id="b537-7">In the Fayette County Circuit Court, a grand jury charged respondent with trafficking in marijuana, first-degree traf­ficking in a controlled substance, and second-degree persist­ent felony offender status. Respondent filed a motion to suppress the evidence from the warrantless search, but the Circuit Court denied the motion. The Circuit Court con­cluded that the officers had probable cause to investigate the marijuana odor and that the officers “properly conducted [the investigation] by initially knocking on the door of the apart­ment unit and awaiting the response or consensual entry.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a. Exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry, the court held, because “there was no response at all to the knocking,” and because “Officer Cobb heard movement in the apartment which he reasonably con­cluded were persons in the act of destroying evidence, partic­ularly narcoties because of the smell.” Ibid. Respondent then entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion. The court sentenced respondent to 11 years’ imprisonment.</p>
                <p pgmap="537(16) 538(31)" id="b537-8">The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed. It held that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry be­cause the police reasonably believed that evidence would be destroyed. The police did not impermissibly create the exi­gency, the court explained, because they did not deliberately evade the warrant requirement.</p>
                <p pgmap="538" id="b538-5">The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed. 302 S. W. 3d 649 (2010). As a preliminary matter, the court observed that there was “certainly some question as to whether the sound of persons moving [inside the apartment] was suffi­cient to establish that evidence was being destroyed.” Id., at 655. But the court did not answer that question. In­stead, it “assume[d] for the purpose of argument that exigent circumstances existed.” Ibid.</p>
                <p pgmap="538" id="b538-6">To determine whether police impermissibly created the exigency, the Supreme Court of Kentucky announced a two-­part test. First, the court held, police cannot “deliberately creat[e] the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.” Id., at 656 (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, even absent bad faith, the court concluded, police may not rely on exigent circum­stances if “it was reasonably foreseeable that the investiga­tive tactics employed by the police would create the exigent circumstances.” Ibid, (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the court found no evidence of bad faith, it held that exigent circumstances could not justify the search be­cause it was reasonably foreseeable that the occupants would destroy evidence when the police knocked on the door and announced their presence.

                <p pgmap="539" id="b539-6">The Fourth Amendment provides:</p>
                <blockquote pgmap="539" id="b539-7">“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, sup­ported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describ­ing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”</blockquote>
                <p pgmap="539" id="b539-8">The text of the Amendment thus expressly imposes two requirements. First, all searches and seizures must be rea­sonable. Second, a warrant may not be issued unless proba­ble cause is properly established and the scope of the author­ized search is set out with particularity. See Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 578, 584 (1980).</p>
                <p pgmap="539" id="b539-9">Although the text of the Fourth Amendment does not specify when a search warrant must be obtained, this Court has inferred that a warrant must generally be secured. “It is a ‘basic principle of Fourth Amendment law/” we have often said, “ ‘that searches and seizures inside a home with­out a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.’ ” Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006) (quoting Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 559 (2004)). But we have also recog­nized that this presumption may be overcome in some cir­cumstances because “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness.’” Brigham City, supra, at 403; see also Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U. S. 45, 47 (2009) (per curiam). Accordingly, the warrant requirement is subject to certain reasonable exceptions. Brigham City, supra, at 403.</p>
                <p pgmap="540" id="b540-4">One well-recognized exception applies when “ ‘the exigen­cies of the situation’ make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively rea­sonable under the Fourth Amendment.” Mincey v. Ari­zona, 437 U. S. 385, 394 (1978); see also Payton, supra, at 590 (‘‘[T]he Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant”).</p>
                <p pgmap="540" id="b540-5">This Court has identified several exigencies that may justify a warrantless search of a home. See Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403. Under the “emergency aid” exception, for example, “officers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.” Ibid.; see also, e. g., Fisher, supra, at 49 (upholding warrantless home entry based on emergency aid exception). Police officers may enter premises without a warrant when they are in hot pur­suit of a fleeing suspect. See United States v. Santana, 427 U. S. 38, 42-43 (1976). And—what is relevant here—the need “to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence” has long been recognized as a sufficient justification for a war­rantless search. Brigham City, supra, at 403; see also Geor­gia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 116, n. 6 (2006); Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U. S. 91, 100 (1990).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>
                </p>
                <p pgmap="541" id="AE">B</p>
                <p pgmap="541" id="b541-4">Over the years, lower courts have developed an exception to the exigent circumstances rule, the so-called “police-­created exigency” doctrine. Under this doctrine, police may not rely on the need to prevent destruction of evidence when that exigency was “created” or “manufactured” by the con­duct of the police. See, e. g., United States v. Chambers, 395 P. 3d 563, 566 (CA6 2005) (“[F]or a warrantless search to stand, law enforcement officers must be responding to an un­anticipated exigency rather than simply creating the exi­gency for themselves”); United States v. Gould, 364 F. 3d 578, 590 (CA5 2004) (en banc) (“[Although exigent circum­stances may justify a warrantless probable cause entry into the home, they will not do so if the exigent circum­stances were manufactured by the agents” (internal quota­tion marks omitted)).</p>
                <p pgmap="541(186) 542(13)" id="b541-5">In applying this exception for the “creation” or “manu­facturing” of an exigency by the police, courts require something more than mere proof that fear of detection by the police caused the destruction of evidence. An additional showing is.' obviously needed because, as the Eighth Circuit has recognized, “in some sense the police always create the exigent circumstances.” United States v. Duchi, 906 P. 2d 1278, 1284 (1990). That is to say, in the vast majority of cases in which evidence is destroyed by persons who are en­gaged in illegal conduct, the reason for the destruction is fear that the evidence will fall into the hands of law enforce­ment. Destruction of evidence issues probably occur most frequently in drug cases because drugs may be easily de­stroyed by flushing them down a toilet or rinsing them down a drain. Persons in possession of valuable drugs are un­likely to destroy them unless they fear discovery by the po­lice. Consequently, a rule that precludes the police from making a warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence whenever their conduct causes the exigency would unreasonably shrink the reach of this well-established excep­tion to the warrant requirement.</p>
                <p pgmap="542" id="b542-5">Presumably for the purpose of avoiding such a result, the lower courts have held that the police-created exigency doc­trine requires more than simple causation, but the lower courts have not agreed on the test to be applied. Indeed, the petition in this case maintains that “[tjhere are currently five different tests being used by the United States Courts of Appeals,” Pet. for Cert. 11, and that some state courts have crafted additional tests, id., at 19-20.</p>
                <p pgmap="542" id="b542-6">Ill</p>
                <p pgmap="542" id="b542-7">A</p>
                <p pgmap="542" id="b542-8">Despite the welter of tests devised by the lower courts, the answer to the question presented in this case follows directly and clearly from the’ principle that permits warrant-­less searches in the first place. As previously noted, war­rantless searches are allowed when the circumstances make it reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, to dispense with the warrant requirement. Therefore, the answer to the question before us is that the exigent circum­stances rule justifies a warrantless search when the con­duct of the police preceding the exigency is reasonable in the same sense. Where, as here, the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment, warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is reasonable and thus allowed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>
                </p>
                <p pgmap="542(19) 543(186)" id="b542-9">We have taken a similar approach in other cases involving warrantless searches. For example, we have held that law enforcement officers may seize evidence in plain view, pro­vided that they have not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of the evi­dence is made. See Horton v. California, 496 U. S. 128, 136-140 (1990). As we put it in Horton, “[i]t is ... an essen­tial predicate to any valid warrantless seizure of incriminat­ing evidence that the officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which the evidence could be plainly viewed.” Id., at 136. So long as this pre­requisite is satisfied, however, it does not matter that the officer who makes the observation may have gone to the spot from which the evidence was seen with the hope of being able to view and seize the evidence. See id., at 138 (“The fact that an officer is interested in an item of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course of a search should not invalidate its seizure”). Instead, the Fourth Amendment re­quires only that the steps preceding the seizure be lawful. See id., at 136-137.</p>
                <p pgmap="543" id="b543-5">Similarly, officers may seek consent-based encounters if they are lawfully present in the place where the consensual encounter occurs. See INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 217, n. 5 (1984) (noting that officers who entered into consent-­based encounters with employees in a factory building were “lawfully present [in the factory] pursuant to consent or a warrant”). If consent is freely given, it makes no difference that an officer may have approached the person with the hope or expectation of obtaining consent. See id., at 216 (“While most citizens will respond to a police request, the fact that people do so, and do so without being told they are free not to respond, hardly eliminates the consensual nature of the response”).</p>
                <p pgmap="543" id="b543-6">B</p>
                <p pgmap="543(42) 544(49)" id="b543-7">Some lower courts have adopted a rule that is similar to the one that we recognize today. See United States v. Mac­Donald, 916 F. 2d 766, 772 (CA2 1990) (en banc) (law enforce­ment officers “do not impermissibly create exigent circum­stances” when they “act in an entirely lawful manner”); State v. Robinson, 2010 WI 80, ¶ 32, 327 Wis. 2d 302, 326-328, 786 N. W. 2d 463, 475-476 (2010). But others, including the Ken­tucky Supreme Court, have imposed additional requirements that are unsound and that we now reject.</p>
                <p pgmap="544" id="b544-5">Bad faith. Some courts, including the Kentucky Supreme Court, ask whether law enforcement officers “ ‘deliberately created the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.’ ” 302 S. W. 3d, at 656 (quoting Gould, 364 F. 3d, at 590); see also, e. g., Chambers, 395 F. 3d, at 566; United States v. Socey, 846 F. 2d 1439, 1448 (CADC 1988); United States v. Rengifo, 858 F. 2d 800, 804 (CA1 1988).</p>
                <p pgmap="544" id="b544-6">This approach is fundamentally inconsistent with our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. “Our cases have repeat­edly rejected” a subjective approach, asking only whether “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify the action.” Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 404 (alteration and internal quo­tation marks omitted); see also Fisher, 558 U. S., at 47-49. Indeed, we have never held, outside limited contexts such as an “inventory search or administrative inspection . . . , that an officer’s motive invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the Fourth Amendment.” Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 812 (1996); see also Brigham City, supra, at 405.</p>
                <p pgmap="544" id="b544-7">The reasons for looking to objective factors, rather than subjective intent, are clear. Legal tests based on reason­ableness are generally objective, and this Court has long taken the view that “evenhanded law enforcement is best achieved by the application of objective standards of conduct, rather than standards that depend upon the subjective state of mind of the officer.” Horton, supra, at 138.</p>
                <p pgmap="544(35) 545(88)" id="b544-8">Reasonable foreseeability. Some courts, again including the Kentucky Supreme Court, hold that police may not rely on an exigency if “‘it was reasonably foreseeable that the investigative tactics employed by the police would create the exigent circumstances.’” 302 S. W. 3d, at 656 (quoting Mann v. State, 357 Ark. 159, 172, 161 S. W. 3d 826, 834 (2004)); see also, e. g., United States v. Mowatt, 513 F. 3d 395, 402 (CA4 2008). Courts applying this test have invalidated warrantless home searches on the ground that it was reason­ably foreseeable that police officers, by knocking on the door and announcing their presence, would lead a drug suspect to destroy evidence. See, e. g., id., at 402-403; 302 S. W. 3d, at 656.</p>
                <p pgmap="545" id="b545-5">Contrary to this reasoning, however, we have rejected the notion that police may seize evidence without a warrant only when they come across the evidence by happenstance. In Horton, as noted, we held that the police may seize evidence in plain view even though the officers may be “interested in an item of evidence and fully expec[t] to find it in the course of a search.” 496 U. S., at 138.</p>
                <p pgmap="545" id="b545-6">Adoption of a reasonable foreseeability test would also in­troduce an unacceptable degree of unpredictability. For ex­ample, whenever law enforcement officers knock on the door of premises occupied by a person who may be involved in the drug trade, there is some possibility that the occupants may possess drugs and may seek to destroy them. Under a rea­sonable foreseeability test, it would be necessary to quantify the degree of predictability that must be reached before the police-created exigency doctrine comes into play.</p>
                <p pgmap="545(113) 546(45)" id="b545-7">A simple example illustrates the difficulties that such an approach would produce. Suppose that the officers in the present case did not smell marijuana smoke and thus knew only that there was a 50% chance that the fleeing suspect had entered the apartment on the left rather than the apart­ment on the right. Under those circumstances, would it have been reasonably foreseeable that the occupants of the apartment on the left would seek to destroy evidence upon learning that the police were at the door? Or suppose that the officers knew only that the suspect had disappeared into one of the apartments on a floor with 3, 5, 10, or even 20 units? If the police chose a door at random and knocked for the purpose of asking the occupants if they knew a person who fit the description of the suspect, would it have been reasonably foreseeable that the occupants would seek to de­stroy evidence?</p>
                <p pgmap="546" id="b546-5">We have noted that “[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments — in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396-397 (1989). The reasonable fore­seeability test would create unacceptable and unwarranted difficulties for law enforcement officers who must make quick decisions in the field, as well as for judges who would be required to determine after the fact whether the destruction of evidence in response to a knock on the door was reason­ably foreseeable based on what the officers knew at the time.</p>
                <p pgmap="546" id="b546-6">Probable cause and time to secure a warrant. Some courts, in applying the police-created exigency doctrine, fault law enforcement officers if, after acquiring evidence that is sufficient to establish probable cause to search particular premises, the officers do not seek a warrant but instead knock on the door and seek either to speak with an occupant or to obtain consent to search. See, e. g., Chambers, supra, at 569 (citing “[t]he failure to seek a warrant in the face of plentiful probable cause” as a factor indicating that the police deliberately created the exigency).</p>
                <p pgmap="546" id="b546-7">This approach unjustifiably interferes with legitimate law enforcement strategies. There are many entirely proper reasons why police may not want to seek a search warrant as soon as the bare minimum of evidence needed to establish probable cause is acquired. Without attempting to provide a comprehensive list of these reasons, we note a few.</p>
                <p pgmap="546(42) 547(181)" id="b546-8">First, the police may wish to speak with the occupants of a dwelling before deciding whether it is worthwhile to seek authorization for a search. They may think that a short and simple conversation may obviate the need to apply for and execute a warrant. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 228 (1973). Second, the police may want to ask an occupant of the premises for consent to search because doing so is simpler, faster, and less burdensome than applying for a warrant. A consensual search also “may result in con­siderably less inconvenience” and embarrassment to the occupants than a search conducted pursuant to a warrant. Ibid. Third, law enforcement officers may wish to obtain more evidence before submitting what might otherwise be considered a marginal warrant application. Fourth, prose­cutors may wish to wait until they acquire evidence that can justify a search that is broader in scope than the search that a judicial officer is likely to authorize based on the evidence then available. ' And finally, in many cases, law enforcement may not want to execute a search that will disclose the exist­ence of an investigation because doing so may interfere with the acquisition of additional evidence against those already under suspicion or evidence about additional but as yet un­known participants in a criminal scheme.</p>
                <p pgmap="547" id="b547-5">We have said that “[l]aw enforcement officers are under no constitutional duty to call a halt to criminal investigation the moment they have the minimum evidence to establish probable cause.” Hoffa v. United States, 385 U. S. 293, 310 (1966). Faulting the police for failing to apply for a search warrant at the earliest possible time after obtaining probable cause imposes a duty that is nowhere to be found in the Constitution.</p>
                <p pgmap="547(85) 548(10)" id="b547-6">Standard or good investigative tactics. Finally, some lower court cases suggest that law enforcement officers may be found to have created or manufactured an exigency if the court concludes that the course of their investigation was “contrary to standard or good law enforcement practices (or to the policies or practices of their jurisdictions).” Gould, 364 F. 3d, at 591. This approach fails to provide clear guid­ance for law enforcement officers and authorizes courts to make judgments on matters that are the province of those who are responsible for federal and state law enforcement agencies.</p>
                <p pgmap="548" id="b548-5">C</p>
                <p pgmap="548" id="b548-6">Respondent argues for a rule that differs from those dis­cussed above, but his rule is also flawed. Respondent con­tends that law enforcement officers impermissibly create an exigency when they “engage in conduct that would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry is imminent and inev­itable.” Brief for Respondent 24. In respondent’s view, relevant factors include the officers’ tone of voice in announc­ing their presence and the forcefulness of their knocks. But the ability of law enforcement officers to respond to an exi­gency cannot turn on such subtleties.</p>
                <p pgmap="548" id="b548-7">Police officers may have a very good reason to announce their presence loudly and to knock on the door with some force. A forceful knock may be necessary to alert the occu­pants that someone is at the door. Cf. United States v. Banks, 540 U. S. 31, 33 (2003) (Police “rapped hard enough on the door to be heard by officers at the back door” and announced their presence, but defendant “was in the shower and testified that he heard nothing”). Furthermore, unless police officers identify themselves loudly enough, occupants may not know who is at their doorstep. Officers are permit­ted — indeed, encouraged — to identify themselves to citizens, and “in many circumstances this is cause for assurance, not discomfort.” United States v. Drayton, 536 U. S. 194, 204 (2002). Citizens who are startled by an unexpected knock on the door or by the sight of unknown persons in plain clothes on their doorstep may be relieved to learn that these persons are police officers. Others may appreciate the op­portunity to make an informed decision about whether to answer the door to the police.</p>
                <p pgmap="548(39) 549(35)" id="b548-8">If respondent’s test were adopted, it would be extremely difficult for police officers to know how loudly they may an­nounce their presence or how forcefully they may knock on a door without running afoul of the police-created exigency rule. And in most cases, it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine whether that threshold had been passed. The Fourth Amendment does not require the nebulous and impractical test that respondent proposes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>
                </p>
                <p pgmap="549" id="b549-4">D</p>
                <p pgmap="549" id="b549-5">For these reasons, we conclude that the exigent circum­stances rule applies when the police do not gain entry to premises by means of an actual or threatened violation of the Fourth Amendment. This holding provides ample protection for the privacy rights that the Amendment protects.</p>
                <p pgmap="549(54) 550(123)" id="b549-6">When law enforcement officers who are not armed with a warrant knock on a door, they do no more than any private citizen might do. And whether the person who knocks on the door and requests the opportunity to speak is a police officer or a private citizen, the occupant has no obligation to open the door or to speak. Cf. Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 497-498 (1983) (“[H]e may decline to listen to the ques­tions at all and may go on his way”). When the police knock on a door but the occupants choose not to respond or to speak, “the investigation will have reached a conspicuously low point,” and the occupants “will have the kind of warning that even the most elaborate security system cannot pro­vide.” Chambers, 395 F. 3d, at 577 (Sutton, J., dissenting). And even if an occupant chooses to open the door and speak with the officers, the occupant need not allow the officers to enter the premises and may refuse to answer any questions at any time.</p>
                <p pgmap="550" id="b550-5">Occupants who choose not to stand on their constitutional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy evidence have only themselves to blame for the warrantless exigent circumstances search that may ensue.</p>
                <p pgmap="550" id="b550-6">IV</p>
                <p pgmap="550" id="b550-7">We now apply our interpretation of the police-created exi­gency doctrine to the facts of this ease.</p>
                <p pgmap="550" id="b550-8">A</p>
                <p pgmap="550" id="b550-9">We need not decide whether exigent circumstances existed in this case. Any warrantless entry based on exigent cir­cumstances must, of course, be supported by a genuine exi­gency. See Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 406. The trial court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals found that there was a real exigency in this case, but the Kentucky Supreme Court expressed doubt on this issue, observing that there was “cer­tainly some question as to whether the sound of persons moving [inside the apartment] was sufficient to establish that evidence was being destroyed.” 302 S. W. 3d, at 655. The Kentucky Supreme Court “assum[ed] for the purpose of ar­gument that exigent circumstances existed,” ibid., and it held that the police had impermissibly manufactured the exigency.</p>
                <p pgmap="551" id="b551-4">We, too, assume for purposes of argument that an exigency existed. We decide only the question on which the Ken­tucky Supreme Court ruled and on which we granted cer­tiorari: Under what circumstances do police impermissibly create an exigency? Any question about whether an exi­gency actually existed is better addressed by the Kentucky Supreme Court on remand. See Kirk v. Louisiana, 536 U. S. 635, 638 (2002) (per curiam) (reversing state-court judgment that exigent circumstances were not required for warrantless home entry and remanding for state court to determine whether exigent circumstances were present).</p>
                <p pgmap="551" id="b551-5">B</p>
                <p pgmap="551" id="b551-6">In this case, we see no evidence that the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so prior to the point when they entered the apartment. Officer Cobb testified without contradiction that the officers “banged on the door as loud as [they] could” and announced either “ ‘Po­lice, police, police’” or “‘This is the police.’” App. 22-23. This conduct was entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment, and we are aware of no other evidence that might show that the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so (for example, by announc­ing that they would break down the door if the occupants did not open the door voluntarily).</p>
                <p pgmap="551(110) 552(135)" id="b551-7">Respondent argues that the officers “demanded” entry to the apartment, but he has not pointed to any evidence in the record that supports this assertion. He relies on a passing statement made by the trial court in its opinion denying re­spondent’s motion to suppress. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a-4a. In recounting the events that preceded the search, the judge wrote that the officers “banged on the door of the apartment on the back left of the breezeway identifying themselves as police officers and demanding that the door be opened by the persons inside.” Ibid, (emphasis added and deleted). However, at a later point in this opinion, the judge stated that the officers “initially knock[ed] on the door of the apartment unit and await[ed] the response or consensual entry.” Id., at 9a. This later statement is con­sistent with the testimony at the suppression hearing and with the findings of the state appellate courts. See 302 S. W. 3d, at 651 (The officers “knocked loudly on the back left apartment door and announced 'police’”); App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a (The officers “knock[ed] on the door and an­nounc[ed] themselves as police”); App. 22-24. There is no evidence of a “demand” of any sort, much less a demand that amounts to a threat to violate the Fourth Amendment.

As Officer Cobb testified, the officers “knew that there was possibly something that was going to be de­stroyed inside the apartment,” and “/aJt that point, . . . [they] explained . . . [that they] were going to make entry.” Ibid, (emphasis added). Given that this announcement was made after the exigency arose, it could not have created the exigency.</p>

Respondent’s argument is fore­closed by United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U. S. 579, 581, n. 2 (1983). As we explained in Villamonte-Marquez, our reversal of the Ken­tucky Supreme Court’s decision “would reinstate the judgment of convic­tion and the sentence entered” by the Circuit Court. Ibid.

                  <p pgmap="549" id="b549-7">5 Contrary to respondent’s argument, see Brief for Respondent 13-18, Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10 (1948), does not require affirmance in this case. In Johnson, officers noticed the smell of burning opium ema­nating from a hotel room. They then knocked on the door and demanded entry. Upon seeing that Johnson was the only occupant of the room, they placed her under arrest, searched the room, and discovered opium and drug paraphernalia. Id., at 11.</p>
                  <p pgmap="549" id="b549-8">Defending the legality of the search, the Government attempted to jus­tify the warrantless search of the room as a valid search incident to a lawful arrest. See Brief for United States in Johnson v. United States, O. T. 1947, No. 329, pp. 13, 16, 36. The Government did not contend that the officers entered the room in order to prevent the destruction of evi­dence. Although the officers said that they heard a “‘shuffling’” noise inside the room after they knocked on the door, 333 U. S., at 12, the Gov­ernment did not claim that this particular noise was a noise that would have led a reasonable officer to think that evidence was about to be de­stroyed. Thus, Johnson is simply not a case about exigent circumstances. See id., at 14-15 (noting that if “exceptional circumstances” existed — for example, if a “suspect was fleeing or likely to take flight” or if “evidence or contraband was threatened with removal or destruction” — then “it may be contended that a magistrate’s warrant for search may be dispensed with”).</p>

                <p pgmap="553" id="AIB">dissenting.</p>
                <p pgmap="553" id="b553-5">The Court today arms the police with a way routinely to dishonor the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement in drug cases. In lieu of presenting their evidence to a neutral magistrate, police officers may now knock, listen, then break the door down, never mind that they had ample time to ob­tain a warrant. I dissent from the Court’s reduction of the Fourth Amendment’s force.</p>
                <p pgmap="553" id="b553-6">The Fourth Amendment guarantees to the people “[t]he right... to be secure in their ... houses . .. against unrea­sonable searches and seizures.” Warrants to search, the Amendment further instructs, shall issue only upon a show­ing of “probable cause” to believe criminal activity is afoot. These complementary provisions are designed to ensure that police will seek the authorization of a neutral magistrate be­fore undertaking a search or seizure. Exceptions to the warrant requirement, this Court has explained, must be “few in number and carefully delineated,” if the main rule is to remain hardy. United States v. United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U. S. 297, 318 (1972); see Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 31 (2001).</p>
                <p pgmap="553" id="b553-7">This case involves a principal exception to the warrant re­quirement, the exception applicable in “exigent circum­stances.” See ante, at 460. “[CJarefully delineated,” the exception should govern only in genuine emergency situa­tions. Circumstances qualify as “exigent” when there is an imminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that evi­dence will be immediately destroyed, or that a suspect will escape. Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006). The question presented: May police, who could pause to gain the approval of a neutral magistrate, dispense with the need to get a warrant by themselves creating exigent circum­stances? I would answer no, as did the Kentucky Supreme Court. The urgency must exist, I would rule, when the po­lice come on the scene, not subsequent to their arrival, prompted by their own conduct.</p>

                <p pgmap="554" id="b554-4">Two pillars of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence should have controlled the Court’s ruling: First, “whenever practical, [the police must] obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure,” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 20 (1968); second, unwarranted “searches and seizures inside a home” bear heightened scru­tiny, Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 586 (1980). The warrant requirement, Justice Jackson observed, ranks among the “fundamental distinctions between our form of government, where officers are under the law, and the police-state where they are the law.” Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 17 (1948). The Court has accordingly declared warrantless searches, in the main, “per se unreason­able.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 390 (1978); see also Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 559 (2004). “[T]he police bear a heavy burden,” the Court has cautioned, “when at­tempting to demonstrate an urgent need that might justify warrantless searches.” Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 749-750 (1984).</p>
                <p pgmap="554" id="b554-5">That heavy burden has not been carried here. There was little risk that drug-related evidence would have been de­stroyed had the police delayed the search pending a magis­trate’s authorization. As the Court recognizes, “[p]ersons in possession of valuable drugs are unlikely to destroy them unless they fear discovery by the police.” Ante, at 461. Nothing in the record shows that, prior to the knock at the apartment door, the occupants were apprehensive about police proximity.</p>
                <p pgmap="554(72) 555(115)" id="b554-6">In no quarter does the Fourth Amendment apply with greater force than in our homes, our most private space which, for centuries, has been regarded as “ ‘entitled to spe­cial protection.’” Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 115, and n. 4 (2006); Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 99 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Home intrusions, the Court has said, are indeed “the chief evil against which ... the Fourth Amendment is directed.” Payton, 445 U. S., at 585 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511 (1961) (“At [the Fourth Amendment’s] very core stands the right of a man. to retreat to his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.”). “ ‘[Searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are [therefore] presumptively unreasonable.’” Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403 (quoting Groh, 540 U. S., at 559). How “secure” do our homes remain if police, armed with no war­rant, can pound on doors at will and, on hearing sounds indic­ative of things moving, forcibly enter and search for evidence of unlawful activity?</p>
                <p pgmap="555" id="b555-5">II</p>
                <p pgmap="555" id="b555-6">As above noted, to justify the police activity in this case, Kentucky invoked the once-guarded exception for emergen­cies “in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant. . . threaten^] ‘the destruction of evidence.’” Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770 (1966) (quoting Preston v. United States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)). To fit within this exception, “police action literally must be [taken] ‘now or never’ to preserve the evidence of the crime.” Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U. S. 496, 505 (1973).</p>
                <p pgmap="555" id="b555-7">The existence of a genuine emergency depends not only on the state of necessity at the time of the warrantless search; it depends, first and foremost, on “actions taken by the police preceding the warrantless search.” United States v. Coles, 437 F. 3d 361, 367 (CA3 2006). See also United States v. Chambers, 395 F. 3d 563, 565 (CA6 2005) (“[O]fficers must seek a warrant based on probable cause when they believe in advance they will find contraband or evidence of a crime.”). “[W]asting a clear opportunity to obtain a warrant,” there­fore, “disentitles the officer from relying on subsequent exi­gent circumstances.” S. Saltzburg &amp; D. Capra, American Criminal Procedure 376 (8th ed. 2007).</p>
                <p pgmap="555(16) 556(119)" id="b555-8">Under an appropriately reined-in “emergency” or “exigent circumstances” exception, the result in this case should not be in doubt. The target of the investigation’s entry into the building, and the smell of marijuana seeping under the apart­ment door into the hallway, the Kentucky Supreme Court rightly determined, gave the police “probable cause . .. suf­ficient ... to obtain a warrant to search the .. . apartment.” 302 S. W. 3d 649, 653 (2010). As that court observed, noth­ing made it impracticable for the police to post officers on the premises while proceeding to obtain a warrant authoriz­ing their entry. Id., at 654. Before this Court, Kentucky does not urge otherwise. See Brief for Petitioner 35, n. 13 (asserting “[i]t should be of no importance whether police could have obtained a warrant”).</p>
                <p pgmap="556" id="b556-5">In Johnson, the Court confronted this scenario: standing outside a hotel room, the police smelled burning opium and heard “some shuffling or noise” coming from the room. 333 U. S., at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted). Could the police enter the room without a warrant? The Court an­swered no. Explaining why, the Court said:</p>
                <blockquote pgmap="556" id="b556-6">“The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home is ... a grave concern, not only to the individual but to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance. When the right of pri­vacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman ....</blockquote>
                <blockquote pgmap="556" id="b556-7">“If the officers in this ease were excused from the constitutional duty of presenting their evidence to a magistrate, it is difficult to think of [any] case in which [a warrant] should be required.” Id., at 14-15.</blockquote>
                <p pgmap="556(19) 557(48)" id="b556-8">I agree, and would not allow an expedient knock to override the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Instead, I would accord that core requirement of the Fourth Amendment full respect. When possible, “a warrant must generally be secured,” the Court acknowledges. Ante, at 459. There is every reason to conclude that securing a warrant was entirely feasible in this case, and no reason to contract the Fourth Amend­ment’s dominion.</p>
                <footnote label="*">
                  <p pgmap="556(37) 557(81)" id="b556-9">*The Court in Johnson was informed that “when [the officer] knocked on [Johnson’s] door the ‘first thing that naturally struck [her]’ was to con­ceal the opium and the equipment for smoking it.” See Brief for United States in Johnson v. United States, O. T. 1947, No. 329, p. 17, n. 6. Had the Government in Johnson urged that the “shuffling or noise” indicated evidence was at risk, would the result have changed? Justice Jackson’s recognition of the primacy of the warrant requirement suggests not. But see ante, at 469, n. 5 (distinguishing Johnson on the ground that the Gov­ernment did not contend “that the officers entered the room in order to prevent the destruction of evidence”).</p>
